ANECDOTES

OF THE

LEARNED PIG [1].


The great and learned Pig, of which it is our hap to Å¿peak, was
produced in a Å¿ty belonging to an old Tory, bookÅ¿eller, in [2]
_Moorfields_. At that time _Moorfields_ was diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by rails
which [3] fluttered with party writings and libels of every Å¿ort; and
it is remarkable that his mother, during her pregnancy, tore down from
thoÅ¿e rails, and fairly devoured one whole volume of _Filmer_ and all
_Sacheverell_âs Å¿ermons at a meal; after which Å¿he was obÅ¿erved to
grunt more and louder, and to lie longer in the Å¿un, and deeper in the
mire, than it had before been her cuÅ¿tom to do. She was delivered of
our Pig on the morning of the _tenth of June_. He was Å¿trong and bony,
but of an inelegant form, and betrayed a very uncommon roughneÅ¿s in
his Å¿queak; and it was Å¿oon after remarked by the neighbours, that his
trottings after his mother were made in [4] zig-zags, and not in
Å¿traight lines as is uÅ¿ual with other pigs. After his mother, however,
he reÅ¿olutely trotted, and one morning, as ill fortune would have it,
into a garden which had belonged to the great _Milton_, and was now in
the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of one of his daughters. Here he fed voraciouÅ¿ly upon
_white roÅ¿es_, whilÅ¿t his lady mother was buÅ¿ily employed in rooting up
all the _red ones_. He was in this place Å¿eized by the owner, and Å¿o
Å¿everely whipped, that he thought no other than that Å¿he was whipping
him to death in preparation for a luxurious meal. Of this whipping he
retained through life the higheÅ¿t reÅ¿entment, and bore ever after the
moÅ¿t inveterate hatred of the whole _Miltonic line_. On the fifth of
November following he was taken up, without any warrant, by the rabble,
for the uÅ¿es of a _Whig feaÅ¿t_, and was very near being _roaÅ¿ted_ at
the Å¿ame fire with the _Pope_, the _Devil_, and the _Pretender_; but
this being diÅ¿covered to be Å¿omething _meaÅ¿ly_, he was turned
looÅ¿e to be cured, as they deridingly Å¿aid, by the [5] _royal touch_.
Of this event he retained the Å¿trongeÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿ibility, and conÅ¿idered
ever after his fellow Å¿ufferers, the _Pope_ and the _Pretender_, with
great complacence, if not affection; but as to the other _party_,
though expoÅ¿ed to the Å¿ame diÅ¿honours, there was Å¿omething in his
horns and his tail which he could never be brought to endure.
The touch already mentioned, though profanely Å¿neered at by the _Whig
rabble_, was Å¿oon afterwards in good earneÅ¿t applied; but Å¿o great an
obliquity of head had by this time taken place, that it could never
be perfectly reÅ¿tored. Upon this memorable occaÅ¿ion there was placed
about his neck a ribband of _true blue_, to which hung a Å¿ilver coin,
diÅ¿playing royal lineaments of the _Stuart line_, making Å¿o Å¿trong
an impreÅ¿Å¿ion on his young fancy, that for that line he ever after
retained the moÅ¿t [6] paÅ¿Å¿ionate regard. Thus decorated, he conÅ¿idered
himÅ¿elf, and was conÅ¿idered by others, as a kind of [7] _Tantony_, or
_St. Anthony_âs Pig, belonging to the Crown. Not long after this period
he was heard one morning as he lay in the Å¿un to grunt forth,
portentouÅ¿ly the following rhymes:

 Gruntledum, gruntledum, gruntledum, Å¿queak,

 I hope very Å¿oon to be able to Å¿peak;

 Through my griÅ¿tly proboÅ¿cis, I find, that I can

 Already cry _Ay_ like a Parliament man:

 Like a maid I Å¿queak, like a lover can whine,

 And Å¿nort like an Alderman laden with wine.

 Gruntledum, gruntledum, gruntledum, Å¿queak,

 I hope very Å¿oon to be able to Å¿peak.

      [1] âHe was not at all offended, when, comparing all our
      acquaintance to Å¿ome animal or other, we pitched upon the
      elephant for his reÅ¿emblance, adding, that the proboÅ¿cis of that
      creature was like his mind moÅ¿t exactly, Å¿trong to buffet even
      the tyger, and pliable to pick up even the pin.ââPiozzi, p.
      205.âN.B. For elephant our author probably read _pig_.

      [2] We have Å¿ought for information concerning this fact, that
      the gentleman deÅ¿ignated in the text was born in _Moorfields_,
      or that his father was a bookÅ¿eller there, which, however, we
      confeÅ¿s to have heard, but when or where we can by no means
      remember.

      [3]
      Cloath Å¿pice, line trunks, or fluttâring in a row,
      Befringe the rails of _Bedlam_ or Soho.
                                    POPEâS IM. OF HORACE, Ep. I. B. 2.

      [4] âWhen in company where he was not free, or when engaged
      earneÅ¿tly in converÅ¿ation, he never gave way to Å¿uch habits,
      which proves that they were not involuntary.â I Å¿till, however,
      think, that theÅ¿e geÅ¿tures were involuntary; for Å¿urely had not
      that been the caÅ¿e, he would have reÅ¿trained them in the public
      Å¿treets.âBoÅ¿wellâs Tour, p. 9.

      [5] The pretence of a miraculous power in the cure of the evil
      was the moÅ¿t extraordinary Å¿train of that King-craft of which
      James the FirÅ¿t Å¿o loudly boaÅ¿ted. No manly man, under the
      circumÅ¿tances of the caÅ¿e, would have Å¿et up this pretence, or
      have expected any effect from it but that of public deriÅ¿ion and
      contempt; but weak and credulous men take, perhaps, the beÅ¿t
      meaÅ¿ure of human weakneÅ¿s and credulity, and Å¿o deep did this
      fraud Å¿trike its roots, that, authenticated as it was by the
      clergy, and annually certified by the Å¿urgeons and phyÅ¿icians
      of the royal houÅ¿ehold, it Å¿urvived the civil war, was reÅ¿tored
      with Charles the Second, extended beyond the revolution, and was
      only extinguiÅ¿hed by the act of Å¿ettlement, which, taking the
      principles of the BritiÅ¿h government out of the clouds, placed
      them on the firm baÅ¿is of the earth. The pretenÅ¿ions of Alexander
      were of a bolder and more rational Å¿ort, and held to be Å¿o
      important, that his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors, who had no kindred intereÅ¿t in
      the horns of Ammon, yet mingled them in their crowns and tiaras,
      till at laÅ¿t the Roman Titans tumbled from their Å¿eats one after
      another theÅ¿e fictitious gods. The moÅ¿t deceitful glimmer of
      divine claim Å¿eems to have had more influence on the mind of the
      perÅ¿on who Å¿eems to have been deÅ¿ignated in the text, than the
      moÅ¿t Å¿olid principles of political right.

      [6] âI mentioned Lord Hailes as a man of anecdoteâHe was not
      pleaÅ¿ed with him for publiÅ¿hing only Å¿uch memorials as were
      unfavourable for the _Stuart_ family.ââBoÅ¿wellâs Tour, p. 312.

      [7] Tantony pigs were pigs who belonged formerly to the Convent
      of St. Anthony in the city. Collars were placed about their
      necks, inÅ¿cribed _St. Anthony_. They fed all over the town, and
      out of reÅ¿pect to the fathers of that convent, it was uÅ¿ual for
      the paÅ¿Å¿engers to give them biÅ¿cuits, and other things carried
      for that purpoÅ¿e in their pockets. The pigs of courÅ¿e followed
      the paÅ¿Å¿engers in this expectation; and hence came the expreÅ¿Å¿ion
      of one perÅ¿onâs following another like a Tantony pig.

This being publicly known, the neighbours now put on him a human coat,
in which condition he appeared as if the _Hog in armour_ had deÅ¿cended
from his Å¿ign-poÅ¿t to mingle in Å¿ociety, and converÅ¿e with man. Nor did
they Å¿top here, but ventured alÅ¿o to recommend him for a penÅ¿ion to
the great _miniÅ¿terial hog_, though, for the preÅ¿ent, however, without
effect; for though it was evident enough that our learned Pig could Å¿ay
_Ay_, yet it did not follow that he would be always diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to
do Å¿o. He was therefore turned looÅ¿e into the Å¿oil of this great town
to Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t as he could, where, _idling_ and _rambling_, he picked up
Å¿ometimes flowers, and Å¿ometimes thiÅ¿tles, a great number of Greek and
Hebrew roots, with an immenÅ¿e quantity of verbage of every Å¿ort [8]. It
is for his honour that he routed in this rich compoÅ¿t for years without
giving any offence, except that, through reÅ¿entment to the Miltonic
line, he aÅ¿Å¿ociated rather too long with a very obÅ¿cene animal of the
pig kind, called a [9] _Lauder_; and except, that he was taken
Å¿ometimes with Å¿trange freaks, and fancied once that he Å¿aw
Å¿omething in the [10] Å¿hape of a Å¿ound of a knocking; and excepting
alÅ¿o his too Å¿onorous gruntulations, and that long concatenation of
Å¿oapy bubbles which uÅ¿ually frothed from his mouth [11]. In the
midÅ¿t of theÅ¿e reÅ¿earches he had one morning the good fortune to throw
up this Å¿entiment in rhyme:

 Say, what is a Tory? A Tory is he

 Who thinks kicking Å¿hould paÅ¿s through every degree;

 And that all political motion Å¿hould go

 From the toe to the bum, from the bum to the toe.

 Then what is a [12] Whig? A dog full of knavery,

 A raÅ¿cal, a Å¿coundrel impatient of Å¿lavery,

 A malignant, a thief;âthen tell me if Whig

 Be any more better than gruntledum pig?

      [8] The perÅ¿on here deÅ¿igned is allowed by the courteÅ¿y of the
      times to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s a nervous and elegant Å¿tile; but Å¿o unhappy is
      the writer of this note, that he can by no means concur in the
      general praiÅ¿e. He has a notion of Saxon Å¿implicity, from which
      all departure, not enforced by neceÅ¿Å¿ity, and regulated by taÅ¿te,
      aÅ¿Å¿imilating, as much as may be, foreign words to the genius of
      the Saxon tongue, is to him intolerable. But the writer here
      Å¿poken of was wholly deficient in taÅ¿te, and appears to refer his
      EngliÅ¿h to Å¿ome foreign Å¿tandard chanting forth polyÅ¿yllables,
      and tiring the ear with dull returns of the Å¿ame cadences, for
      ever advancing like a poÅ¿t horÅ¿e, two up and two down, and
      incapable of changing his pace, without throwing both himÅ¿elf and
      his rider in the dirt. But hack writers, like hack horÅ¿es, find
      it for their eaÅ¿e to practiÅ¿e an uniform rate.

      [9] _There is_, Å¿ays a remarker on the life of Milton, _a
      high degree of prepollent probability that the letter in the
      Gentlemanâs Magazine for the month of AuguÅ¿t 1747, page 363 and
      364, Å¿igned William Lauder, came from the amicable hand of the
      writer of that life_. I do not, however, believe that the writer
      of Miltonâs life was in the Å¿ecret of Lauderâs forgeries, the
      fact itÅ¿elf being of Å¿o extraordinary a nature, that it is not
      probable that any two perÅ¿ons, Å¿eparately capable of committing
      it, Å¿hould Å¿o fortuitouÅ¿ly meet together; yet Å¿uch was his
      malevolence towards Milton, that we muÅ¿t admit it to have greatly
      clouded his underÅ¿tanding. He undoubtedly wrote the preface and
      the poÅ¿tÅ¿cript to Lauderâs publication: in alluÅ¿ion to which,
      Doctor Douglas Å¿ays, _that âtis hoped, nay âtis expected, that
      the the elegant and nervous writer, whoÅ¿e judicious Å¿entiments
      and inimitable Å¿tyle point out author of Lauderâs preface and
      poÅ¿tÅ¿cript, will no longer allow one to plume himÅ¿elf with his
      feathers, who appears Å¿o little to have deÅ¿erved his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance_.
      Lauder confeÅ¿Å¿es his guilt in a letter to Doctor Douglas, and
      takes all the obloquy on himÅ¿elf; but in a Å¿ubÅ¿equent letter he
      declares, that the penitential one was written for him by that
      very gentleman, who has Å¿ince written the life of Milton, and
      makes Å¿ome complaints of a breach of friendÅ¿hip, _in which he
      had placed the moÅ¿t implicit and unlimited confidence_; but as
      he never charged, that I know of, the writer of Miltonâs life
      with any participation in the forgery, we impute to him nothing
      but a Å¿trange malignity which darkened his underÅ¿tanding. It
      muÅ¿t be owned, however, that he cut off the wreck of Lauder with
      great management, as well as competent Å¿ucceÅ¿s. I remember that
      he boaÅ¿ts in his life of Milton of his having written a prologue
      to the Comus of Milton, for the benefit of one of his grand
      daughters. This, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, he would paÅ¿s for his benevolence;
      but he muÅ¿t excuÅ¿e me; I am not Å¿o much the dupe of charity as to
      believe, that he who Å¿o brutally calumniates Milton, his father,
      mother, uncles, wives, and children, _and all unfortunate Å¿ouls
      that trace him in his line_, would be moved by any charitable
      diÅ¿poÅ¿ition towards any deÅ¿cendant of Miltonâs, as being Å¿uch.
      The fact, I believe, is, that, finding Milton reduced by the
      labours of his friend Lauder to a level with his wiÅ¿hes, he
      practiÅ¿ed, in concurrence with Mr. Lauder, one further act of
      malice, and endeavoured to fix an obligation on Milton in the
      perÅ¿on of his granddaughter, conferred by his moÅ¿t inveterate
      foes as the effect of Å¿atiated vengeance, converted into mingled
      pity and contempt. If there is any harÅ¿hneÅ¿s in this note, let
      it be remembered, that it Å¿peaks of a man who, in the inÅ¿tance
      mentioned, let looÅ¿e the moÅ¿t outrageous malignity againÅ¿t one,
      who, whatever political errors he might have imbibed in common
      with a great majority of the nation, was, however, as a private
      man, of Å¿o exemplary a virtue, as to do the higheÅ¿t honour
      to literary purÅ¿uit, and whoÅ¿e genius, as a poet, conferred
      celebrity on the nation itÅ¿elf, and in whoÅ¿e protection therefore
      we ought to have taken a greater Å¿hare.

      [10] The hiÅ¿tory of this knocking is curious; it forms Å¿uch a
      drama of comedy, tragedy, and farce, from its firÅ¿t commencement
      in Cock Lane, paÅ¿Å¿ing through the Å¿olemn vaults of Clerkenwell,
      and then to WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter Hall, as, I believe, never was exhibited
      in any other country; a drama wherein childiÅ¿hneÅ¿s and age,
      gravity, dignities, folly, fraud, Å¿uperÅ¿tition, and credulity,
      were all largely and confuÅ¿edly thrown in to thicken the plot.
      That the perÅ¿on here deÅ¿ignated Å¿hould carry out of this Å¿cene
      any reÅ¿pectability of character, is a proof that either he muÅ¿t
      have poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed great intrinÅ¿ic worth, who could bear Å¿uch large
      deductions, or that public opinion has ceaÅ¿ed to be the teÅ¿t of
      merit, if any baÅ¿e metal can in this manner paÅ¿s current for gold.

      [11] Our biographer Å¿hould have told us alÅ¿o, that once he joined
      the train of fancy, and paÅ¿Å¿ing the limits of fact, entered by
      the ShakeÅ¿pearean gate into fairy land. But in an evil hour, âNo
      favouring Sybil marked the devious way.â Never was man or pig Å¿o
      aÅ¿tounded! and no wonder. He had Å¿tumbled unaccountably on the
      creations of Å¿enÅ¿ibility, and found no correÅ¿ponding emotions
      within; yet, unconÅ¿cious of defect, he pretended a knowledge of
      the country, and even offered himÅ¿elf as an unerring guide; but
      not long; for, tired with the maze, he gave way, at length, to
      new adventurers, and fled as another Gulliver out of Lilliput,
      where he had only encumbered the land.

      [12] âNo man, however, was more jealouÅ¿ly attached to his party;
      he not only loved a man the better, if he hated a _Whig_. Dear
      BathurÅ¿t, Å¿aid he to me one day, was a man to my very heartâs
      content; he hated a fool, and he hated a rogue, and he hated a
      _Whig_; he was a very good hater.ââPiozziâs Memoirs, p. 83.

      â_Pulteney_ was as paltry a fellow as could be. He was a _Whig_,
      who pretended to be honeÅ¿t; and you know it is ridiculous for a
      _Whig_ to pretend to be honeÅ¿t.â BoÅ¿wellâs Journal, p. 424.

      Talking of GrangerââThe dog is a _Whig_: I do not like much to
      Å¿ee a Whig in any dreÅ¿s; but I hate to Å¿ee a _Whig_ in a parÅ¿onâs
      gown.ââ_Ibid._ p. 312.

There needed no more; a penÅ¿ion was immediately hung about his neck,
and the letters L.Â L.Â D. Å¿oon afterwards impreÅ¿Å¿ed on his rump [13].
And now who but our Pig? lying in the Å¿un, cheek by jowl, by the great
miniÅ¿terial Hog, routing in the political Å¿oil, and throwing up daily
the moÅ¿t delicious pig-nuts with his Å¿nout; nor did theÅ¿e
diÅ¿coveries reÅ¿t wholly in himÅ¿elf; for the great Hog would Å¿ometimes
let fall, from behind, certain rich, but often crude and ill-digeÅ¿ted,
materials, which were taken up in the WeÅ¿tphalian mode by our Pig, and
delivered again better concocted to the many-headed beaÅ¿t: and hence
we were taught, that Taxation was no Tyranny, and that a good American
war was a very commodious and Å¿alutary thing. Great applauÅ¿e enÅ¿ued,
but not unattended with envy, there being at the time many Å¿narlers who
have Å¿aid, and now Å¿ay, that it were better if our Pig had been, before
this period, well Å¿ouÅ¿ed in the pickling tub, and that even the great
miniÅ¿terial Hog himÅ¿elf had been hung up for bacon. I decide nothing
on theÅ¿e brawls; yet, having reÅ¿pect to a certain Å¿uppoÅ¿ed dignity in
our Pig, it may, perhaps, excite Å¿ome wonder, that he, whoÅ¿e politics
were of no older a date than his penÅ¿ion, and who had hitherto never
routed out of the moral track, Å¿hould all at once lend himÅ¿elf out
in this manner, and make his conÅ¿cience reÅ¿ponÅ¿ible for meaÅ¿ures, of
the principles or effects of which he muÅ¿t have been Å¿o incompetent
a judge. But I anÅ¿wer in few words, that, like all other
politicians, he had his propenÅ¿ities; that it was, perhaps, the nature
of the animal, and that mingling his humours and his reaÅ¿on together,
there might have been a competent Å¿incerity in the caÅ¿e. But what Å¿hall
we Å¿ay to the indecency of his turning up the graves of _Pope_ and [14]
_Swift_, (for I Å¿peak not now of Milton) and goring them, Tories as
they were, with Å¿o malicious a tooth? I anÅ¿wer, firÅ¿t, that they were
not Tories. _Pope_ placed his glory in moderation; and _Swift_ was the
renegade of one party, without being the convert of the other. But it
was not _Whig_ or _Tory_, I believe, which now moved our Pig: there are
other inÅ¿tinctive enmities in the world. TheÅ¿e men of real genius were
Å¿atiriÅ¿ts by profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and the natural enemies of PigÅ¿ââ_The fewer
Å¿till I name_,â Å¿ays Pope, â_I hurt the more_.âââ_Bond is but one, but
Balaam is a Å¿core_;â and again, âAn hundred Å¿mart in _Timon and in
Balaam_.â And I believe that our Pig Å¿marted in _Bentley_, _Tibbald_,
and poÅ¿Å¿ibly in many others; the Å¿torm had but juÅ¿t patted
before him, and he heard the arrowy Å¿hower Å¿till rattle in his ear, and
was conÅ¿cious, perhaps, that had he come forth a day Å¿ooner, he would
have been placed in a diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed, but, to him, a very unpleaÅ¿ant,
niche in the Dunciad of _Pope_,

 âSacred to ridicule his whole life long,

 âAnd the Å¿ad burden of Å¿ome merry Å¿ong.â

      [13] Our author daÅ¿hes away from thing to thing with very
      little method or order. He might, however, have touched on the
      occupation of a Å¿choolmaÅ¿ter, Å¿o honourable for a _pig_; in proof
      of which, we could have furniÅ¿hed him with the following document:

      âAt Edial, near Litchfield, in StaffordÅ¿hire, young gentlemen
      are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek languages by Samuel
      JohnÅ¿on.â
                        ADVERTISEMENT IN THE GENT. MAG. 1736, p. 428.

      [14] âHe Å¿eemed to me to have an unaccountable prejudice againÅ¿t
      Swift; for I once took the liberty to aÅ¿k him, if Swift had
      perÅ¿onally offended him; and he told me, he had not.ââBoÅ¿wellâs
      Tour, p. 38.

Where he inÅ¿ults therefore the mighty dead, his rage is at leaÅ¿t
natural; and when, to wound _Pope_, he Å¿uborns the tongue of a [15]
kitchen wench, he preÅ¿erves, however, a nice proportion between his
end and his means, doing, with very Å¿ingular propriety, the baÅ¿eÅ¿t
thing in, what muÅ¿t be allowed to be, the loweÅ¿t way. But we abÅ¿tain,
we affect not gravity, we even forget his almoÅ¿t felonious attack upon
Milton, and proceed. We have already noted the facility with which
our learned Pig could Å¿ay _Ay_. It was a great accompliÅ¿hment;
but he had alÅ¿o his defects. [16] No art, no inÅ¿truction could ever
bring him to make a tolerable bow, or indeed to practice any civil
grimace whatever; and his higheÅ¿t approach, in this way, towards
humanity, never went farther than to entitle him, from the moÅ¿t
exquiÅ¿ite judge, to the character of a very _reÅ¿pectable Hottentot_:
and hence he became at laÅ¿t to be conÅ¿idered as a very great [17]
_Bore_; under which diÅ¿grace he retired to a brewery in the
Borough.âHappy retirement! for here he was fed with the freÅ¿heÅ¿t grains
by the fair hand of a lady, who condeÅ¿cended to become the prieÅ¿teÅ¿s
of our Pig; a lady who had acquired the Greek language without loÅ¿ing
her own, and whoÅ¿e manners and latinity were both equally pure. How
great therefore muÅ¿t have been his grief, when he afterwards Å¿aw
his fair provider melt away into the arms of a Å¿oft, but doubtleÅ¿s
Å¿inewy Signor, and bathe herÅ¿elf, as it is yet her fortune to do, in
the voluptuous warmths of Italy. But herâs, however be the praiÅ¿e,
that, compoÅ¿ed of gentle paÅ¿Å¿ions, Å¿he conÅ¿cientiouÅ¿ly Å¿acrificed,
at thirty-eight, fortune, freedom, and England, only to legalize her
delights. Never in any future period may Å¿he be repentant of her
choice, but always find in the joys of harmony a compenÅ¿ation for
the decays of love. From the fair hand of this lady our Pig was not
only fed with the fineÅ¿t grains, but with the choiceÅ¿t green peas alÅ¿o,
the earlieÅ¿t of the yearâdelicious food, as he himÅ¿elf confeÅ¿Å¿esâfor a
[18] _Pig_. By her too was prepared for him the moÅ¿t inviting draff,
which he Å¿willed up at all hours with huge avidity and delight. But the
lady had her humours; Å¿he grew tired of one thing, and fond of another;
Å¿he Å¿ought, upon preÅ¿Å¿ing inducements, the great rendezvous of Bath;
and Å¿o the joys of the brewery had an end. Many were of opinion, (for
who can pleaÅ¿e all,) that a certain diÅ¿tillery in the neighbourhood
would have been a more apt and proper retreat for our Pig;âbut there
were difficulties; I enter not into domeÅ¿tic affairs; but whether there
was any whiggiÅ¿m, or rivalÅ¿hip, or jealouÅ¿y, or what elÅ¿e in the caÅ¿e,
I know not; but certain it is, that Sir JoÅ¿eph and he could
never, as they ought, well pig together. During the happy period above
mentioned, it came into the fancy of our Pig to journey into Scotland
in the character of a travelling bear, with a ragged Å¿taff in his paws,
and a [19] monkey on his back. When he firÅ¿t obtained a penÅ¿ion, he
had been very affectionately conÅ¿idered by the people of that country,
and in a manner naturalized, and become one of them; but he diÅ¿covered
Å¿oon afterwards, and more particularly on this occaÅ¿ion, Å¿o much of the
badger in his diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, that they found great reaÅ¿on to complain of
the Å¿trength and harÅ¿hneÅ¿s of his jaw. On his return he reÅ¿orted again
to his beloved brewery, as yet profuÅ¿e of grains and draff, where he
grunted forth, as was his cuÅ¿tom, many Å¿trange and Å¿ingular things,
faithfully now on record, pretending alÅ¿o to cure certain mental
diÅ¿eaÅ¿es by the medicinal qualities of his tongue; but its extreme
roughneÅ¿s the Å¿enÅ¿ibility of his patients could not bear. Enough has
been Å¿aid; the reÅ¿t Å¿hall be left to Bozzy. Yet we will add,
that with all his peculiarities, he had virtues and merits enough to
make us heartily wiÅ¿h he were Å¿till in being:âBut, alas, it is paÅ¿t,
and he is now cutting up into junks, to be Å¿old _pro bono publico_ at
nine different Å¿hops in retail.

      [15] MoÅ¿t of what can be told concerning his petty peculiarities
      was communicated by a female domeÅ¿tic of the Earl of Oxford, who
      knew him, perhaps, after the middle of life.âJohnÅ¿onâs Lives of
      the Poets, 8vo. vol. 4, p. 141.

      [16] And yet certain it is that no pains was Å¿pared for this
      purpoÅ¿e; for âmy mother (Å¿aid he) was always telling me that
      I did not behave myÅ¿elf; that I Å¿hould endeavour to learn
      behaviour, and Å¿uch cant.â Indeed his defect in this particular
      could not be overlooked by his moÅ¿t partial admirer; for âI
      Å¿uppoÅ¿e none (Å¿ays Å¿he) who Å¿aw his odd manner of geÅ¿ticulation,
      much blamed or wondered at the good ladyâs Å¿olicitude concerning
      her Å¿onâs behaviour.ââPiozziâs Memoirs of JohnÅ¿on, p. 24 and 25.

      [17] Cant words are uÅ¿ually begot in a cellar by _fun_ upon
      _folly_: but the word _bore_ and _boar_ has another origin; it
      was begot on a Å¿ofa by _MadamoiÅ¿elle Ennui_ upon herÅ¿elf, and
      brought forth into the world in the midÅ¿t of the ton. The roar
      and fury of the river Severn the people of the country call the
      _boar_. A female Å¿aint was reported miraculouÅ¿ly to have Å¿hed
      tears: the fact was denied by a Madrid carpenter who had made
      the Å¿aint, âbecauÅ¿e (Å¿ays he) Å¿he is not only compoÅ¿ed of heart
      of oak, but if Å¿he had been at all diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to weep, Å¿he muÅ¿t
      have wept when I _bored_ an aperture with my largeÅ¿t augre in
      her rump.â And thus teazing and vexation of every kind may be
      called a _bore_. A dun is a _bore_, and a Å¿ermon is a _bore_, and
      Å¿o forth; but the greateÅ¿t of all poÅ¿Å¿ible _bores_, in whatever
      Å¿pelling, is a huÅ¿band, a _bore_ at night, a _bore_ in the
      morning, and, in Å¿hort, one general univerÅ¿al _bore_. Our author
      has uÅ¿ed this faÅ¿hionable word with the moÅ¿t perfect propriety,
      in a Å¿enÅ¿e Å¿atisfying the very letter, as well as Å¿pirit of the
      word.

      [18] When we went into Wales together, and Å¿pent Å¿ome time at Sir
      Robert Cottonâs at Llewenney, one day at dinner I meant to pleaÅ¿e
      Mr. JohnÅ¿on particularly with a diÅ¿h of very young peas.ââAre not
      they charming?â Å¿aid I to him, while he was eating them.ââPerhaps
      (Å¿aid he) they would be Å¿oâto a Pig.ââPiozzi, p. 63.

      [19] This paÅ¿Å¿age Å¿eems inexplicable. We have had reÅ¿ort to Bozz,
      but in vain: the Å¿taff, indeed, he readily acknowledged; but as
      to the other aÅ¿Å¿ociate, or who, or what was meant, neither he nor
      we were able to diÅ¿cover.

Transcriber's note:

Footnotes have been renumbered 1â19 and moved from within paragraphs
natural breaks in paragraphs. We would ordinarily have moved the
footnotes to the end of the book, we but did not wish to entirely
deprive you of the ambience that readers of the original printed book
enjoyed.

Original printed spelling and grammar are retained, with one exception:

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
