ON JUDGMENT DAY.

A certain priest and a parishioner were visiting one night and judgment
day was mentioned.

âWhat dâye mean, âjudgmentâ day?â the man inquired.

âJudgment day,â replied the priest, âis the day when all who have
died are brought up for judgment, when their sins are judged and the
verdictâjudgmentâis pronounced.â

âAha,â exclaimed the man. âAnd will the A. P. A.âs be there?â

âYes, the A. P. A.âs will be there.â

âWill the Ancient Order of Hibernians be there?â

âThey certainly will! Why?â

âWell, Iâm thinking thereâll be mighty little âjudgingâ done the first
few hours, thin!â

       *       *       *       *       *

PatââThat McGinty is a fine fellow.â

MickââIs he?â

PatââHe is, indeed. Great friend of mine. Did you notice how heartily he
shook hands with me?â

MickââI did.â

PatââGreat friend of mine. He wasnât satisfied with shaking one hand, but
he grabbed hold of both.â

MickââI suppose he thought his watch and chain would be safer that way.â

EASY FOR PADDY.

At a political meeting an Irishman watched closely the trombone player
in the band. Presently the man laid down his instrument and went out for
a beer. Paddy investigated, and promptly pulled the horn to pieces. The
player returned. âWhoâs meddled mit my drombone?â he roared. âOi did,â
said Paddy. âHere yeâve been for two hours tryinâ to pull it apart, anâ
Oi did it in wan minute!â

       *       *       *       *       *

MikeââWhat a red nose that Sweeney has.â

âWhist, man; he spint a barrel of money to get it to the pink of
perfection.â

       *       *       *       *       *

It was in the wilds of Tipperary, and the local and long-suffering
landlord had been ill-advised enough to ask for a bit of rent on
accountâthe same being some few years overdue. Roused to fury at this
unlooked-for and, in their eyes, outrageous demand, Mike and Pat decided
to âwait forâ the base and greedy tyrant. And they didâbehind a hedge
with a shot-gun. An hour passed. Their feet and their fingers were numbed
with the cold, and, worse than that, the dhrop or half-bottle of the
crathur was gone.

Said Pat to Mike, in a hoarse whisper: âShure, anâ I hope nothing can
have happened to the onfortunate gintleman!â

Not long ago a young Irishman was seeking work in western Illinois, and
among those to whom he applied was a farmer near Cairo.

The farmer was attracted by the Celtâs frank, cheery manner, and, while
he was not in need of help, he asked, after a pause:

âCan you cradle?â

âCradle!â repeated the Irishman. âSure, I can! But, sir,â he added
persuasively, âcouldnât ye give me a job out of dures?â

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. MurphyââOi hear yer brother-in-law, Pat Keegan, is pretty bad off.â

Mrs. CaseyââShure, heâs good for a year yit.â

Mrs. MurphyââAs long as that?â

Mrs. CaseyââYes; heâs had four different doctors, and each one uv thim
gave him three months to live.â

       *       *       *       *       *

A Dundee shopkeeper asked an Irishman who was standing at a street corner
if he wanted a job.

âYes, sor,â replied the Irishman.

âWell, now, what would you take to clear the snow away from my premises?â

âA shovel, sor!â was the sharp reply of the Irishman.

He got the job.

       *       *       *       *       *

A SAVING, ANYWAY.

OâBrienââSo the landlord lowered the rint for yez. Heâll save money at
that.â

CaseyââHow so?â

OâBrienââShure, itâs less heâll be losinâ when ye donât pay it.â

MAKING GOOD USE OF HIM.

An Italian organ-grinder possessed a monkey which he âworkedâ through
the summer months. When the cool days came his business fell off, and
he discontinued his walks and melodies. An Irishman of his acquaintance
offered him half a dollar a week for the privilege of keeping and feeding
the little beast. The bargain was made for a month.

Great curiosity filled the mind of the Italian, and at last he went
ostensibly to see his pet, but really to find out what possible use Pat
could make of the monkey.

The Irishman was frank. âItâs loike this,â he said. âOi put up a pole in
the back yard, with the monkey on the top. Ten or twelve trains of cars
loaded with coal go by here every eveninâ. Thereâs men on every car.
Every man takes a heave at the monk. Divil a wan has hit him, but Oi have
sivin tons of coal.â

       *       *       *       *       *

PRETTY LOUD.

An Irishman came to a doctor complaining that he had noises in his head.

âOi have them all the time,â he said, âanâ sometimes Oi can hear thim
fifty feet away.â

       *       *       *       *       *

âPhwat koind av a room would yez loike to hov, sor? Oi can givâ yez a
back room in the front av thâ house, or a front room in thâ back av
thâ house jist to suit yer inconvaynience; or Oi can givâ yez number
sixty-six or ninety-nine, jist to suit yer inconvaynienceâNo. 66 is thâ
broidle chamber, but we kape thâ broidle out in thâ shtable.

âOi can givâ yez another lovely room in thâ middle av the front av thâ
hotel, sorâitâs a lovely place; there do be carpet on thâ floor; air
cushion sofys anâ bir-rds-eye maple chifâniers anâ runninâ hot anâ cold

âSay, Mr. Clerk, thereâs a lady without!â

âWidout phwat; widout phwat?â

âWithout here, in the hall, sir.â

âThatâs all right; show her up in thâ parlor; Oiâll be up in a minute.â

âSay, Mr. Clerk, thereâs a man upstairs in room 78, says thereâs bedbugs
in his bed!â

âPhwat! Bedbugs in his bed? Go up and ask him if he wants humming bir-ds
in his bed fer a dollar a day?â

âSay, Mr. Clerk, thereâs a man upstairs in room 97 who says the rain came
through the skylight last night and wet him to the skin.â

âWet him to thâ skin; charge him 25 cents extra fer thâ bath. Gâwan out
av here!â

CallerââYour masterâs not at home, eh, Pat?â

PatââNo, sor; he do be in the ould country these târee wakes, sor.â

CallerââExcuse me, Pat, but how is it when your mistress is on this side
of the water masterâs on the other, and vice versa? Is there trouble
between them?â

PatââNone at all, sor; only they have agrade bechune âem that they can
live together better when theyâre apart.â

The PrisonerââThere goes my hat. Shall I run after it?â

Officer CaseyââPhwat? Run away and never come back again? Not on your
life. You stand here and Iâll run after your hat.â

       *       *       *       *       *

PRECAUTION.

Mrs. CaseyââMe sister writes me that every bottle in the box we sent her
was broken. Are you sure yez printed âThis side up with careâ on it?â

CaseyââOi am. Anâ for fear they shouldnât see it on the top Oi printed it
on the bottom as well.â

       *       *       *       *       *

DANGER!

An Irishman visiting a friend in the hospital began to take an interest
in the other patients.

âWhat are you in here for?â he asked one.

âIâve got tonsillitis, and Iâve got to have my tonsils cut out,â was the
answer.

âAnd you?â he asked another.

âIâve got blood poisoning in my arm, and they are going to cut it off,â
was the reply.

âHeavens!â said Pat, in horror, âThis ainât no place for me. Iâve got a
cold in my head.â

       *       *       *       *       *

âMike, did you ever catch frogs?â âYes, sor.â âWhat did you bait with?â
âBate âem with a shtick, sor.â

       *       *       *       *       *

People that take all things literally are apt to tread on other peopleâs
toes. The Irishman who walked in where he saw a sign, âWalk in,â and who
was ordered out by the lawyer was a literal man, and so was the man that
went into a pawnbrokerâs shop and demanded ten dollars because there was
a placard in the window that read,âLook at this watch for ten dollars.â

âI looked at it,â said he, âand now I want my ten dollars.â

The most amusing incident we have heard is that of the countryman who,
while sauntering along a city street, saw a sign, âPlease ring the bell
for the janitor.â

After reflecting a few minutes he walked up and gave the bell such a pull
that it nearly came out by the roots.

In a few minutes an angry-faced man opened the door.

âAre you the janitor?â asked the bell-puller.

âYes; what do you want?â

âI saw that notice, so I rang the bell for you, and now I want to know
why you canât ring the bell yourself?â

       *       *       *       *       *

An Irishman wanted to sell a dog, but the prospective buyer was
suspicious, and finally decided not to buy. The man then told him why he
was anxious to sell. âYou see,â said he, âI bought the dog and thrained
him myself. I got him so heâd bark all the time if a person stepped
inside the gate, and I thought I was safe from burglars. Then me woife
wanted me to thrain him to carry bundlesâand I did. If you put anything
into his mouth, the spalpeenâd keep it there till some one took it away.
Well one night I woke up and heard some one in the next room. I got up
and grabbed me gun. They were there, three of the blackguards and the
dog.â

âDidnât he bark,â interrupted the other.

âSorra a bark,â was the reply, âhe was too busy.â

âBusy,â asked the other, âwhat doing?â

âCarrying the lantern for the burglars,â answered the Irishman.

       *       *       *       *       *

NO NEED TO TELL.

Casey (rolling up his sleeves)ââDid you tell Reilly Oi was a liar?â

MurphyââOi did not. Oi thought he knew it!â

       *       *       *       *       *

Paddy Dolan bought a watch from the local jeweller with a guaranty to
keep it in order for twelve months. About six months after, Paddy took it
back because it had stopped.

âYou seem to have had an accident with it,â said the jeweller.

âA small one, sure enough, sir. About two months ago I was feeding the
pig and it fell into the trough.â

âBut you should have brought it before.â

âSure, your honor, I brought it as soon as I could. We only killed the
pig yesterday.â

Kathleen had been put out to service, and her mistress liked the rosy
face of the young girl. One day Kathleen was sent on an errand to town.
She was longer than usual and her mistress stood on the porch as she came
through the field. Kathleen was happy and her mistress observed:

âWhy, Kathleen, what a rosy face you have to-day! You look as if the dew
had kissed you.â

Kathleen dropped her eyes and murmured:

âIndeed, maâam, but that wasnât his name!â

An Irishman, who couldnât read, went into a restaurant and sat down
opposite a man who had a bill of fare in his hands, and concluded
to order whatever the other man ordered in order not to betray his
disordered learning.

StrangerââI will have a plate of soup.â

PatââGive me thâ same.â

StrangerââAnd some oysters.â

PatââGive me thâ same.â

The stranger ordered what he wanted, and Pat duplicated the order.
Finally, the stranger told the waiter to order him a bootblack.

âGive me the same,â said Pat.

âWonât one do for both of you?â

Pat answeredââNo, one wonât; if he canât eat one, I can!â

       *       *       *       *       *

âWhy did you leave your last place?â the housekeeper asked of the new
would-be cook.

âTo tell the truth, mum, I just couldnât stand the way the master anâ the
missus used to quarrel, mum.â

âDear me! Do you mean to say that they actually used to quarrel?â

âYis, mum, all the time. When it wasnât me anâ him, it was me and her.â

A gentleman was put out of patience by some blunder of Paddy, his new
groom.

âLook here!â he cried in his anger; âI wonât have things done in this
way. Do you think Iâm a fool?â

âI canât say, sir,â answered Paddy; âI only came here yesterday.â

ONE OF THE SIGHTS.

A man was visiting Ireland for the first time. In Dublin one warm
afternoon he put his handkerchief over his nose and said, in a choked
voice, âWhat the deuce is that?â

âThat?â said his Irish guide. âWhy, thatâs the river Liffey. Didnât ye
know, man, that the smell oâ the Liffey was one oâ the sights oâ Dublin?â

       *       *       *       *       *

A little Irishman was being examined for admission to the army. He seemed
all right in every way except one. The doctor said: âYouâre a little
stiff.â

Quickly his Irish blood mounted and he replied: âYouâre a big stiff.â

       *       *       *       *       *

NOT HIS NAME.

In Dublin a zealous policeman caught a cab driver in the act of driving
recklessly. The officer stopped him and said:

âWhatâs yer name?â

âYouâd better try to find out,â said the driver peevishly.

âSure, and I will,â said the policeman as he went around to the side of
the cab where the name ought to have been painted, but the letters had
been rubbed off.

âAha!â cried the officer. âNow yeâll git yerself into worse disgrace than
ever. Yer name seems to be oblitherated.â

âYouâre wrong!â shouted the driver triumphantly. ââTis OâSullivan.â

       *       *       *       *       *

NATURAL HISTORY.

They were looking at the kangaroo at the zoo when an Irishman said:

âBeg pardon, sor, phwat kind of a crature is that?â

âOh,â said the gentleman, âthat is a native of Australia.â

âGood hivins!â exclaimed Pat; âanâ me sister married wan eâ thim.â

A wizened little Irishman applied for a job loading a ship. At first they
said he was too small, but he finally persuaded them to give him a trial.
He seemed to be making good, until they gradually increased the size of
his load until on the last trip he was carrying a 300-pound anvil under
each arm. When he was half-way across the gangplank it broke and the
Irishman fell in. With a great splashing and sputtering he came to the
surface.

âTârow me a rope!â he shouted, and again sank. A second time he rose to
the surface. âTârow me a rope. I say!â he shouted again. Once more he
sank. A third time he rose struggling.

âSay!â he spluttered angrily, âif one uv you shpalpeens donât hurry up
anâ târow me a rope Iâm goinâ to drop one uv these damn tâings!â

THE LAST OF THE CARRS.

Mrs. Nora Mulvaney met her old friend, Mrs. Bridget Carr, carrying in her
arms her twelfth child.

âArrah, now, Bridget,â said Nora, âanâ there ye are wid another little
Carr in yer arms.â

âAnother it is, Mrs. Mulvaney,â replied her friend, âanâ Iâm hopinâ âtis

Mike sat busily engaged in copying the names of the male population of
the immediate vicinity. His good wife, noting the apparent industry of
her lord, asked what he was doing.

âBegorra, anâ itâs wroitinâ the names oâ the min phwat Oi kin lick, so Oi
am!â he exclaimed.

A few minutes later the woman put on her shawl and went to Pat OâLearyâs
humble home, where she informed Pat that she saw his name on the list.

Without waiting to don his coat, OâLeary sallied forth in search of Mike,
who was found still engaged at the list.

âMoike,â said Pat, in a tone that sounded like the thunders of heaven,
âthey say as how yez air makinâ a lisht oâ the felleys yez kin lick anâ
thot me nameâs on it.â

âAnâ so âtis,â retorted Mike.

âBut, rist yer sowl,â exclaimed Pat, shaking his fist close to Mikeâs
proboscis, âyez canât do it!â

âThin Iâll scratch yer name off,â said Mike, feebly, and he continued
adding to the list.

An old widdy woman went to the undertakerâs to order a coffin for her
deceased husband.

âHe was very, very good to me,â she said,âand Iâll have a coffin of the
best yellow pine.â

âYes, madam. Thatâll be $14,â said the undertaker. âAnd what kind of

Caseyâs wife is anxious to be a society woman and the Ancient Order of
the Knights of the Golden Hod were going to give their annual riotâI mean
ballâand as Casey is the chief hodâI mean knightâof course he had to be
there and his wife wanted to shineâof course Caseyâs a shine butâsaid she
to Casey: âIâm going to have a new dress for the ball. Iâm going to have
the bias cut and flounced with crepe de chene and with Charlotte rucheing
around the neckâandââ

âWhat are you going to have it made out of?â said Mr. Casey.

âSo that itâll be light Iâll have it made out of cheese-cloth,â answered
Mrs. Casey.

âCheese-cloth?â said Casey.

Softly the nurse smoothed the suffererâs pillow. He had been admitted
only that morning, and now he looked up pleadingly at the nurse that
stood at his bedside.

âAnâ phwat did ye say the doctherâs name was, nurse, dear,â he asked.

âDr. Kilpatrick,â was the reply. âHeâs the senior house surgeon.â

âThat settles it,â he muttered, firmly, âthat docther wonât get a chanst

Patrick worked for a notoriously stingy boss and lost no chance to let

OâBrien died, and at the wake his friends got filled up with good
whiskey. They finally took OâBrienâs body down to Kellyâs saloon and sat
it in a chair at a table and drank his health. After several rounds they
left the place, forgetting OâBrienâs body, which they left sitting at the
table where they had placed it. Kelly wanted to close up, so he walked
over to OâBrien and shook him, trying to wake him up. Failing in his
efforts to arouse him, he became angry, and securing a club from behind
the bar, smashed OâBrien over the head with it. OâBrien fell to the
floor, and just at that moment his friends came back to get the corpse,
having remembered him. They pretended to be horrified, and charged Kelly
with having killed OâBrien with a club. âYouâve murdered him in cold
blood,â said one of the gang. âYouâre a liar,â said Kelly, âhe pulled a

âThereâs your bed, Pat, and there are two more to sleep with you, but
they wonât be in till late, so donât be alarmed.â

âTheyâre welcome,â replied Pat. Before retiring Pat locked his bedroom
door and during the night he was awakened by great knocking.

âWhose there?â asked Pat.

âWe are the lodgers. Open.â

âNo room for ye,â replied Pat.

âHow many of you are in the room?â they asked.

âEnough,â said Pat. âThereâs meself, Paddy Murphy, a man that came over

She was a sweet little thing with the most waspy of wasplike waists, and
passers-by had nothing but admiration in their eyes for her.

But what was that? She had fainted. Tenderly they carried her into a drug

minutes, and inquired:

âHow is she now?â

âOh,â was the reply, âsheâs coming to.â

BREAKING THE NEWS.

Pat had been delegated by his fellow employees to tell Mrs. Casey the
news of her husbandâs accidental death. On the way to the Casey home, Pat
pondered on how to break the news to the widow. Finally he hit on what
seemed to him a most humane way of preparing Mrs. Casey for the sad news.

Knowing the violent hatred which Mrs. Casey as well as all loyal Irishmen
have for the A. P. A., he said on greeting the woman:

âAh, Mrs. Casey, it is bad news I have to bring you. Your husband, Mike,
has turned an A. P. A.â

âMike turned A. P. A.! The scoundrel, I hope he is dead.â

figures weâd have no way of findinâ out how late the trains are.â

âAnd donât be as long-winded in your next reports as you have been in the
past,â said the superintendent; âjust report the condition of the roadbed
as you find it, and donât use a lot of needless words that are not to the
point. Write like a business letter, not like a love-letter.â

Tom proceeded on his tour of inspection and when he reached the river, he
wrote his report to the superintendent:

âBut,â said the landlord, âthe sum he has embezzled is far bigger than
his wages.â

âThen raise his wages,â suggested an Irishman.

A Galway man named Pat Carr was met one day by an English tourist, who
said to him:

âWhatâs your name?â

âCarr,â said Pat.

âWell, well,â said the Englishman, âyouâre the first car I ever saw going
without an ass, so youâre a great curiosity to me.â

âWell,â said Pat, âyouâre not the first ass I saw going without a car, so
youâre no curiosity to me.â

During some building operations it was necessary for the workmen to walk
across a single plank some distance from the ground. Whenever it came to
Patâs turn, the foreman noticed that he walked across on all fours. So he
went up to Pat and asked contemptuously:

âWhatâs the trouble, man? Are you afraid of walking on the plank?â

âNo, begorra,â said Pat, âbut Iâm afraid of walking off it.â

Two young Irishmen in a Canadian regiment were going into the trenches

Pat lay down to rest, while Mick performed the duty of watching. Pat had
not lain long when he was awakened by Mick shouting:

âTheyâre cominâ! Theyâre cominâ!â

âWhoâs cominâ?â shouts Pat.

âThe Germans,â replies Mick.

âHow many are there?â

âAbout fifty thousand.â

Patrick had called on his Betsy and she gave him a handsome helping of

flavor it.â

âBegorra!â cried Patrick. âIf a few gooseberries give so good a flavor

IN IRELAND.

âWe never needed any of them new-fangled scales in Ireland,â said OâHara.
âThereâs an aisy way to weigh a pig without scales. You get a plank and
put it across a stool. Then you get a big stone. Put the pig on one end
of the plank and the stone on the other end, and shift the plank until
they balance. Then you guess the weight of the stone and you have the
weight of the pig.â

The Irishman was walking along the bank of the river. He was fuming with
rage, for that day he had a dispute with a neighbor over the ownership of
a pig. Suddenly a cry for help rent the air and, turning round, he saw a
man struggling in the water.

Seeing Mike on the bank, the man in the water waved his hand and shouted:

âHey, mate, drope me a line!â

In a flash the man on the bank recognized his adversary in the pig
dispute. Thrusting his hands in his pockets he made to resume his walk,
remarking over his shoulder:

âShure, but there ainât no post offices where yeâre goinâ to!â

âSlape on, ye lazy spalpeen, slape on, fur as long as you slape youâve

Again she said he would require to speak louder.

resistance? Had you nothing in your hand to defend yourself with?â

Pat had seen nearly every clock in the place, but had discarded all of
them as not being good enough for his purpose. The weary shopman had
exhausted his whole stock, except a few cuckoo clocks, so he brought
these forward as a last resource, and vowed he would do his best to sell
one or know the reason why.

âDo the clocks strike the hour?â asked Pat, noticing their curious shape,
and half doubting their capacity to do anything.

âIâll show you what they do,â said the salesman; and he set the hands
of one to a few minutes to twelve. When the little door flew open and
the cuckoo thrust his head out, cuckooing away for dear life, Pat was
thunderstruck. But when the bird disappeared he looked glum, and pondered
in gloomy thought for a moment.

âWell, how do you like that?â asked the salesman. âThatâs a staggerer for
you, isnât it?â

âDo ye belave in dhrames, Riley?â

âOi do,â was Rileyâs reply.

âPhwatâs it a sign of if a married man dhrames heâs a bachelor?â

A PECULIAR POISON

Professor OâFlanigan held up a small phial, and the class was silent.
âOne drop of this liquid,â said he, impressively, âplaced upon the tongue
of a cat is sufficient to kill the strongest man!â

For months Pat, who lived in the oil country, had been drilling
unsuccessfully in his back yard. One day his friends were astonished to
see him rush from his door cheering loudly.

âWhatâs the idea, Pat?â he was asked.

âHavenât ye heard the good news?â

âGood Lord! You havenât struck oil at last, have you?â

âNo, not yet. But didnât ye notice how the price of it went up yesterday?â

       *       *       *       *       *

Pat and Mike were engaged in a dispute in a cemetery one day. âWell,â
said Pat, âI donât like this cemetery at all, at all.â

âWell,â said Mike, âI think it is a fine cemetery.â

âNo,â said Pat, âI donât like it at all, at all, and Iâll never be buried
in it as long as I live.â

âWhat an unreasonable ould fool ye are, to be sure,â said Mike, losing
his temper. âWhy man alive, it is a fine cemetery, and if my life is
spared, sure Iâll be buried in it.â

An Irishman said that a friend of his had died suddenly. âDid he live

âAnâ how much did yez spend to get drunk?â asked Mike, rather

Pat Dooley went round to the cabin of Mike Doolan to pass the time of
day to him; but Mike was out. Mrs. Mike was in, boiling the praties and
trying to nurse the child at the same time. Pat, being a polite boy,
offered to dandle the baby while Mrs. Mike stirred the pot.

In came Mike. âGood morning to you, Pat.â

âThe top of the morning to you, Mike, and howâs yourself?â

âItâs gay and grand I am, and how are you, Pat?â

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
