TOLD BY UNCLE REMUS




THE REASON WHY


The main reason why Uncle Remus retired from business as a story-teller
was because the little boy to whom he had told his tales grew to be
a very big boy, and grew and grew till he couldnât grow any bigger.
Meanwhile, his father and mother moved to Atlanta, and lived there for
several years. Uncle Remus moved with them, but he soon grew tired of the
dubious ways of city life, and one day he told his Miss Sally that if
she didnât mind he was going back to the plantation where he could get a
breath of fresh air.

He was overjoyed when the lady told him that they were all going back
as soon as the son married. As this event was to occur in the course of
a few weeks, Uncle Remus decided to wait for the rest of the family.
The wedding came off, and then the father and mother returned to the
plantation, and made their home there, much to the delight of the old
negro.

In course of time, the man who had been the little boy for ever so long
came to have a little boy of his own, and then it happened in the most
natural way in the world that the little boyâs little boy fell under the
spell of Uncle Remus, who was still hale and hearty in spite of his age.

This latest little boy was frailer and quieter than his father had been;
indeed, he was fragile, and had hardly any color in his face. But he was
a beautiful child, too beautiful for a boy. He had large, dreamy eyes,
and the quaintest little ways that ever were seen; and he was polite
and thoughtful of others. He was very choice in the use of words, and
talked as if he had picked his language out of a book. He was a source of
perpetual wonder to Uncle Remus; indeed, he was the wonder of wonders,
and the old negro had a way of watching him curiously. Sometimes, as the
result of this investigation, which was continuous, Uncle Remus would
shake his head and chuckle; at other times, he would shake his head and
sigh.

This little boy was not like the other little boy. He was more like a
girl in his refinement; all the boyishness had been taken out of him by
that mysterious course of discipline that some mothers know how to apply.
He seemed to belong to a different age--to a different time; just how or
why, it would be impossible to say. Still, the fact was so plain that any
one old enough and wise enough to compare the two little boys--one the
father of the other--could not fail to see the difference; and it was a
difference not wholly on the surface. Miss Sally, the grandmother, could
see it, and Uncle Remus could see it; but for all the rest the tendencies
and characteristics of this later little boy were a matter of course.

âMiss Sally,â said Uncle Remus, a few days after the arrival of the
little boy and his mother, âwhat dey gwineter do wid dat chile? What dey
gwineter make out ân âim?â

âIâm sure I donât know,â she replied. âA grandmother doesnât count for
much these days unless there is illness. She is everything for a few
hours, and then she is nothing.â There was no bitterness in the ladyâs
tone, but there was plenty of feeling--feeling that only a grandmother
can appreciate and understand.

âI speck datâs so,â Uncle Remus remarked; âanâ a ole nigger dat oughter
been dead long ago, by good rights, donât count no time anâ nowhar. But
itâs a pity--a mighty pity.â

âWhat is a pity?â the lady inquired, though she knew full well what was
in the old negroâs mind.

âI canât tell you, maâam, anâ âtwouldnât be my place ter tell you ef I
could; but dar âtis, anâ you canât rub it out. I see it, but I canât say
it; I knows it, but I canât show you how ter put yoâ finger on it; yit
itâs dar ef Iâm name Remus.â

The grandmother sat silent so long, and gazed at the old negro so
seriously, that he became restive. He placed the weight of his body first
on one foot and then on the other, and finally struck blindly at some
imaginary object with the end of his walking-cane.

âI hope you ainât mad wid me, Miss Sally,â he said.

âWith you?â she cried. âWhy----â She was sitting in an easy-chair on the
back porch, where the warmth of the sun could reach her, but she rose
suddenly and went into the house. She made a noise with her throat as
she went, so that Uncle Remus thought she was laughing, and chuckled in
response, though he felt little like chuckling. As a matter of fact, if
his Miss Sally had remained on the porch one moment longer she would have
burst into tears.

She went in the house, however, and was able to restrain herself. The
little boy caught at the skirt of her dress, saying: âGrandmother, you
have been sitting in the sun, and your face is red. Mother never allows
me to sit in the sun for fear I will freckle. Father says a few freckles
would help me, but mother says they would be shocking.â

Uncle Remus received his dinner from the big house that day, and by
that token he knew that his Miss Sally was very well pleased with him.
The dinner was brought on a waiter by a strapping black girl, with a
saucy smile and ivory-white teeth. She was a favorite with Uncle Remus,
because she was full of fun. âI dunner how come de white folks treat
you better dan dey does de balance un us,â she declared, as she sat the
waiter on the small pine table and removed the snowy napkin with which
it was covered. âI know it ainât on âcount er yoâ beauty, kaze yoâ ainât
no purtier dan what I is,â she went on, tossing her head and showing her
white teeth.

Uncle Remus looked all around on the floor, pretending to be looking for
some weapon that would be immediately available. Finding none, he turned
with a terrible make-believe frown, and pointed his forefinger at the
girl, who was now as far as the door, her white teeth gleaming as she
laughed.

âMark my words,â he said solemnly; âef I donât brain you befoâ de weekâs
out itâll be bekaze you done been gobbled up by de Unkollopsanall.â The
girl stopped laughing instantly, and became serious. The threats of age
have a meaning that all the gaiety of youth cannot overcome. The gray
hair of Uncle Remus, his impersonation of wrath, his forefinger held up
in warning, made his threat so uncanny that the girl shivered in spite of
the fact that she thought he was joking. Let age shake a finger at you,
and you feel that there is something serious behind the gesture.

Now, Miss Sally had taken advantage of the opportunity to send the
grandchild with the girl; she was anxious that he should make the
acquaintance of Uncle Remus, and have instilled into his mind the quaint
humor that she knew would remain with him all his life, and become a
fragrant memory when he grew old. But the later little boy was very shy,
and when he saw the terrible frown and the threatening gesture with which
Uncle Remus had greeted the girl, he shrank back in a corner, seeing
which the old negro began to laugh. It was not a genuine laugh, but it
was so well done that it answered every purpose.

âI donât see nothinâ ter laugh at,â remarked the girl, and with that she
flirted out.

Uncle Remus turned to the little boy. âHoney, you look so much like Brer
Rabbit dat I bleeze ter laugh. âLong at fust, I had a notion dat you
mought be Mr. Cricket. But youer too big fer dat, anâ den you ainât got
no elbows in yoâ legs. Anâ den I knowâd âtwuz Brer Rabbit I had in minâ.
Yasser, dey ainât no two ways âbout dat--you look like Brer Rabbit when
he tryinâ fer ter make up his minâ whedder ter run er no.â

Then, without waiting to see the effect of this remark, Uncle Remus
turned his attention to the waiter and its contents. âWell, suh!â he
exclaimed, with apparent surprise, âef dar ainât a slishe er tater
custard! Anâ ef I ainât done gone stone blinâ, darâs a dish er homâny
wid ham gravy on it! Yes, anâ bless gracious, darâs a piece er ham! Dey
all look like olâ âquaintances which dey been gone a long time anâ des
come back; anâ dey look like deyer laughinâ kaze dey er glad ter see me.
I wish youâd come here, honey, anâ see ef dey ainât laughinâ; you got
better eyes dan what I is.â

The lure was entirely successful. The little boy came forward timidly,
and when he was within reach, Uncle Remus placed him gently on his knee.
The child glanced curiously at the dishes. He had heard so much of Uncle
Remus from his father and his grandmother that he was inclined to believe
everything the old man said. âWhy, they are not laughing,â he exclaimed.
âHow could they?â

âI speck my eyes is bad,â replied Uncle Remus. âWhen anybody gits ter be
a himbly anâ hombly-hombly year olâ dey er liable fer ter see double.â

The child was a very serious child, but he laughed in spite of himself.
âOh, pshaw!â he exclaimed.

âIâm mighty glad you said dat,â remarked Uncle Remus, smacking his lips,
âkaze ef you hadnât âaâ said it, Iâd âaâ been a bleeze ter say it myseâf.â

âSay what?â inquired the little boy, who was unused to the quips of the
old man.

ââBout dat tater custard. Itâs de funniest tater custard dat I ever laid
eyes on, dey ainât no two ways âbout dat.â

âGrandmother wanted to give me some,â said the little boy longingly, âbut
mother said it wasnât good for me.â

âAha!â exclaimed Uncle Remus in a tone of triumph. âWhat I tell you? Miss
Sally writ on here wid dese dishes dat she want you ter eat dat tater
custard. Moâ dan dat she sont two pieces. Darâs one, anâ dar de yuther.â
There wasnât anything wrong about this counting, except that Uncle Remus
pointed twice at the same piece.

The little boy was sitting on Uncle Remusâs knee, and he turned suddenly
and looked into the weather-beaten face that had harbored so many
smiles. The child seemed to be searching for something in that venerable
countenance, and he must have found it, for he allowed his head to fall
against the old negroâs shoulder and held it there. The movement was as
familiar to Uncle Remus as the walls of his cabin, for among all the
children that he had known well, not one had failed to lay his head where
that of the little boy now rested.

âMiss Sally is de onliest somebody in de rounâ worlâ dat know what you
anâ me like ter eat,â remarked Uncle Remus, making a great pretense of
chewing. âI dunner how she finâ out, but finâ out she did, anâ we oughter
be mighty much beholden ter âer. I done et my piece er tater custard,â he
went on, âanâ you kin eat yone when you git good anâ ready.â

âI saw only one piece,â remarked the child, without raising his head,
âand if you have eaten that there is none left for me.â Uncle Remus
closed his eyes, and allowed his head to fall back. This was his favorite
attitude when confronted by something that he could not comprehend. This
was his predicament now, for there was something in this child that was
quite beyond him. Small as the lad was he was old-fashioned; he thought
and spoke like a grown person; and this the old negro knew was not
according to nature. The trouble with the boy was that he had had no
childhood; he had been subdued and weakened by the abnormal training he
had received.

âTooby sho you ainât seed um,â Uncle Remus declared, returning to the
matter of the potato custard. âEf yoâ pa had âaâ been in yoâ place heâd
âaâ seed um, kaze when he wuz long âbout yoâ age, he had moâ eyes in his
stomach dan what he had his head. But de olâ nigger wuz a little too
quick fer you. I seed de two pieces time de gal snatch de towel off, anâ
I âlow ter myseâf dat ef I didnât snatch one, Iâd not git none. Yasser! I
wuz a little too quick fer you.â

The child turned his head, and saw that the slice of potato custard was
still on the plate. âIâm so sorry that mother thinks it will hurt me,â he
said with a sigh.

âWell, whatsomever she say âbout de yuther piece er custard, I bounâ she
ainât say dat dat piece âud hurt you, kaze she ainât never lay eyes on
it. Anâ moâ dan dat,â Uncle Remus went on with a very serious face: âMiss
Sally writ wid de dishes dat one er de pieces er tater custard wuz fer
you.â

âI donât see any writing,â the child declared, with a longing look at the
potato custard.

âMiss Sally ainât aim fer you ter see it, kaze ef you could see it,
eveâybody could see it. Anâ dat ainât all de reason why you canât see it.
You been hemmed up dar in a big town, anâ yoâ eyes ainât good. But darâs
de writinâ des ez plain ez pig-tracks.â Uncle Remus made believe to spell
out the writing, pointing at a separate dish every time he pronounced a
word. âLeâ me see: she put dis dish fust--âOne piece is fer de chilâ.ââ

The little boy reflected a moment. âThere are only five dishes,â he said
very gravely, âand you pointed at one of them twice.â

âTooby sho I did,â Uncle Remus replied, with well affected solemnity.
âAinât dat de way you does in books?â

The little lad was too young to be well-grounded in books, but he had his
ideas, nevertheless. âI donât see how it can be done,â he suggested. âA
is always A.â

âAh-yi!â exclaimed Uncle Remus triumphantly. âItâs allers big A er
little a. But I waânât callinâ out no letters; I wuz callinâ out de words
what yoâ granmammy writ wid de dishes.â The little boy still looked
doubtful, and Uncle Remus went on. âNow, spozinâ yoâ pa wuz ter come
âlong anâ say, âUnk Remus, I wanter giâ you a cuff.â Anâ den, spozinâ
I wuz ter âlow, âYasser, anâ thanky, too, but you better giâ me a paâr
un um while you âbout it.â Anâ spozinâ heâd be talkinâ âbout maulinâ
me, whiles I wuz talkinâ âbout dem contraptions what you got on yoâ
shirt-sleeves, anâ you ainât got no moâ business wid um dan a rooster is
wid britches. Spozinâ all dat wuz ter happen, how you speck Iâd feel?â

Something in the argument, or the way Uncle Remus held his head,
appealed to the little boyâs sense of humor, and he laughed heartily for
the first time since Uncle Remus had known him. It was real laughter,
too, so real that the old negro joined in with gusto, and the two laughed
and laughed until it seemed unreasonable to laugh any more. To make
matters worse, Uncle Remus pretended to become very solemn all of a
sudden, and then just as suddenly went back to laughter again. This was
more than the little chap could stand. He laughed until he writhed in the
old manâs arms; in fact, till laughter became painful.

âEf we go on dis a-way,â Uncle Remus remarked, âyouâll never eat yoâ
tater custard in de worlâ.â With that, he seized a biscuit and pretended
to place the whole of it in his mouth at once, closing his eyes with a
smile of ecstasy on his face. âDonât, Uncle Remus! please donât!â cried
the little boy who had laughed until he was sore.

At this the old man became serious again. âI hear um say,â he remarked
with some gravity, âdat ef you laugh too much youâll sprain yoâ
goozle-um, er maybe git yoâ thâoat-latch outer jâint. Dat de reason you
see me lookinâ so sollumcolly all de time. You watch me right close, anâ
youâll see fer yoâseâf.â

The little boy ceased laughing, and regarded Uncle Remus closely. The
old negroâs face was as solemn as the countenance of one of the early
Puritans. âYou were laughing just now,â said the child; âyou were
laughing when I laughed.â

The old man looked off into space as though he were considering a
serious problem. Then he said with a sigh: âI speck I did, honey, but how
I gwineter heâp myseâf when I see you winkinâ at dat tater custard? I
mought not âaâ laughed des at dat, but when I see you bekâninâ at it wid
yoâ tongue, I wuz bleeze ter turn loose my hyuh-hyuh-hyuhs!â

This was the beginning of the little boyâs acquaintance with Uncle
Remus, of whom he had heard so much. Some of the results of that
acquaintance are to be set forth in the pages that follow.




I

WHY MR. CRICKET HAS ELBOWS ON HIS LEGS


It was not often that Uncle Remus had to search for the boys who had,
in the course of a very long life, fallen under his influence. On the
contrary, he had sometimes to plan to get rid of them when he had work of
importance to do; but now, here he was in his old age searching all about
for a little chap who wasnât as big as a pound of soap after a hard dayâs
washing, as the old man had said more than once.

The child had promised to go with Uncle Remus to fetch a wagon-load
of corn that had been placed under shelter in a distant part of
the plantation, and though the appointed hour had arrived, and the
carriage-horses had been hitched to the wagon, he had failed to put in an
appearance.

Uncle Remus had asked the nurse, a mulatto woman from the city, where
the child was, and the only reply she deigned to make was that he was all
right. This nurse had been offended by Uncle Remus, who, on more than
one occasion, had sent her about her business when he wanted the little
boy to himself. She resented this and lost no opportunity to show her
contempt.

All his other resources failing, Uncle Remus went to the big house and
asked his Miss Sally. She, being the childâs grandmother, was presumed to
know his whereabouts; but Miss Sally was not in a very good humor. She
sent word that she was very busy, and didnât want to be bothered; but
before Uncle Remus could retire, after the message had been delivered,
she relented. âWhat is it now?â she inquired, coming to the door.

âI wuz des huntinâ fer de little chap,â Uncle Remus replied, âanâ I
âlowed maybe youâd know whar he wuz at. We wuz gwine fer ter haul a load
er corn, but he ainât showed up.â

âWell, I made him some molasses candy--something I shouldnât have
done--and he has been put in jail because he wiped his mouth on his
coat-sleeve.â

âIn jail, maâam?â Uncle Remus asked, astonishment written on his face.

âHe might as well be in jail; heâs in the parlor.â

âWid de winders all down? Heâll stifle in dar.â

The grandmother went into the house too indignant to inform Uncle Remus
that she had sent the house-girl to open the windows under the pretense
of dusting and cleaning. The old man was somewhat doubtful as to how he
should proceed. He knew that in a case of this kind, Miss Sally could not
help him. She had set herself to win over the young wife of her son, and
she knew that she would cease to be the childâs grandmother and become
the mother-in-law the moment her views clashed with those of the ladâs
mother--and we all know from the newspapers what a terrible thing a
mother-in-law is.

Knowing that he would have to act alone, Uncle Remus proceeded very
cautiously. He went around into the front yard, and saw that all the
parlor windows were up and the curtains looped back, something that had
never happened before in his experience. To his mind the parlor was a
dungeon, and a very dark one at that, and he chuckled when he saw the
sunshine freely admitted, with no fear that it would injure the carpet.
If one little bit of a boy could cause such a change in immemorial
custom, what would two little boys be able to do? With these and similar
homely thoughts in his mind, Uncle Remus cut short his chuckle and began
to sing about little Crickety Cricket, who lives in the thicket.

Naturally, this song attracted the attention of the little lad, who had
exhausted whatever interest there had been in an album, and was now
beginning to realize that he was a prisoner. He stuck his head out of the
window, and regarded the old man rather ruefully. âI couldnât go with you
after the corn, Uncle Remus; mother said I was too naughty.â

âI ainât been atter no corn, honey; I hear tell er yoâ gwines on, anâ
I felt too bad fer ter go atter de corn; but de wagginâs all ready anâ
a-waitinâ. Dey ainât no hurry âbout dat corn. Ef you canât go ter-day,
maybe you kin go ter-morrer, er ef not, den some yuther day. Dey ainât
nobody hankerinâ atter corn but de olâ gray mule, anâ heâd hanker anâ
whicker fer it ef you wuz ter feed âim a waggin-load three times a day.
How come you ter be so bad dat yoâ ma hatter shet you up in dat dungeon?
What you been doinâ?â

âMother said I was very naughty and made me come in here,â the little lad
replied.

âI bet you ef dey had âaâ put yoâ pa in der, dey wouldnât âaâ been no
pennaner lefâ, anâ de kyarpit would âaâ looked like it been throo a
harrycane. Dey shet âim up in a room once, anâ dey wuz a clock in it,
anâ he tuck ân tuck dat clock ter pieces fer ter see what make it run.
âTwanât no big clock, needer, but yoâ pa got nuff wheels out er dat clock
fer ter fill a peck medjur, anâ when dey sont it ter town fer ter have
it mended, de clock man say he know mighty well dat all dem wheels ainât
come outer dat clock. He mended it all right, but he had nuff wheels anâ
whirligigs left over fer ter make a nâer clock.â

âThereâs a clock in here,â said the little boy, âbut itâs in a glass
case.â

âDonât pester it, honey, kaze itâs yoâ granmaâs, anâ âtwant yoâ granma
dat had you shot up in dar. No, suh, not her--never in de rounâ worlâ.â

The little prisoner sighed, but said nothing. He was not a talkative
chap; he had been taught that it is impolite to ask questions, and as a
childâs conversation must necessarily be made up of questions, he had
little to say. Uncle Remus found a rake leaning against the chimney. This
he took and examined critically, and found that one of the teeth was
broken out. âNow, I wonder who could âaâ done dat!â he exclaimed. âSholy
nobody wouldnât âaâ come âlong anâ knock de toof out des fer fun. Ef de
times wuz diffunt, Iâd say dat a cricket hauled off anâ kicked it out wid
one er his behime legs. But times done change; dey done change so dat
when I turn my head anâ look backâerds, I hatter ketch my breff I gits
so skeerâd. Dey done been sech a change dat de crickets ainât dast ter
kick sence olâ Grandaddy Cricket had his great kickinâ match. I laid off
fer ter tell you âbout it when we wuz gwine atter dat load er corn datâs
waitinâ fer us; but stidder gwine atter corn, here you is settinâ in de
parlor countinâ out yoâ money.â Uncle Remus came close to the window and
looked in. âOlâ Miss useter keep de Bible on de table dar--yasser! dar
âtis, de same olâ Bible datâs been in de fambly sence de year one. You
better git it down, honey, anâ read dat ar piece âbout de projickinâ son,
kaze ef dey shet you up in de parlor now, deyâll hatter put you in jail
time youer ten year olâ.â

This remark was intended for the ear of the young mother, who had come
into the front yard searching for roses. Uncle Remus had seen her from
the corner of his eye, and he determined to talk so she could hear and
understand.

âBut what will they put me in jail for?â the child asked.

âWhat dey put you in dar fer? Kaze you wipe yoâ mouf on yoâ sleeve.
Well, when you git a little bigger, youâll say ter yoâseâf, âDey shet me
in de parlor fer nothinâ, anâ now Iâll see ef dey âll put me in jail fer
sumpânâ; anâ den youâll make a mouf at de govâner up dar in Atlanta--I
know right whar his house is--anâ deyâll slap you in jail anâ never ax
yoâ name ner whar you come fum. Datâs de way dey does in dat town, kaze I
done been dar anâ see der carryinâs on.â

âI believe Iâll try it when I go back home,â said the little lad.

âCoâse you will,â Uncle Remus assented, âanâ youâll be glad fer ter git
in jail atter beinâ in a parlor what de sun ainât shine in sence de war.
You come down here fer ter git strong anâ well, anâ here you is in de
dampest room in de house. Youâll git well--oh, yes! I see you well right
now, speshually atter you done had de croup anâ de pneumony, anâ de
browncreeturs.â

âThereâs mother,â said the little boy under his breath.

âI wish âtwuz yoâ daddy!â Uncle Remus replied. âIâd giâ âim a piece er my
minâ ez long ez a waggin tongue.â

But the young mother never heard this remark. She had felt she was doing
wrong when she banished the child to the parlor for a trivial fault, and
now she made haste to undo it. She ran into the house and released the
little boy, and told him to run to play. âThank you, mother,â he said
courteously, and then when he disappeared, what should the young mother
do but cry?

The child, however, was very far from crying. He ran around to the front
yard just in time to meet Uncle Remus as he came out. He seized the old
darkyâs hand and went skipping along by his side. âYou put me in minâ er
olâ Grandaddy Cricket âbout de time he had his big kickinâ match. He sho
wuz lively.â

âThat was just what I was going to ask you about,â said the child
enthusiastically, for his instinct told him that Uncle Remusâs remarks
about Grandaddy Cricket were intended to lead up to a story. When they
had both climbed into the wagon, and were well on their way to the Wood
Lot, where the surplus corn had been temporarily stored, the old man,
after some preliminaries, such as looking in his hat to see if he had
lost his hankcher, as he called it, and inquiring of the horses if they
knew where they were going and what they were going after, suddenly
turned to the child with a question: âAinât I hear you ax me âbout sumpân
nâer, honey? Iâm gittinâ so olâ anâ wobbly dat it seem like Iâm deaf, yit
ef anybody wuz ter call me ter dinner, I speck I could hear um a mile off
ef dey so much ez whispered it.â

âYes,â the child replied. âIt was about old Grandaddy Cricket. I thought
maybe you knew something about him.â

âWho? Me, honey? Why, my great-grandaddyâs great-grandaddy live nexâ
door ter whar olâ Grandaddy Cricket live at. Folks is lots littler now
dan what dey wuz in dem days, anâ likewize de creeturs, anâ de creepinâ
anâ crawlinâ things. My grandaddy say dat his great-grandaddy would make
two men like him, anâ my grandaddy wuz a monstâus big man, dey ainât no
two ways âbout dat. It seems like dat folks is swunk up. My grandaddyâs
great-grandaddy say itâs kaze dey done quit eatinâ raw meat.

âI canât tell you âbout dat myself, but my great-grandaddyâs
great-great-grandaddy could eat a whole steer in two days, horn anâ huff,
anâ dem what tolâ me ainât make no brags âbout it; dey done like deyâd
seen it happen nine times a montâ off anâ on fer forty year er moâ. Well,
den,â Uncle Remus went on, looking at the little chap to see if he was
swallowing the story with a good digestion--âwell, den, dat beinâ de
case, it stanâs ter reason dat de creeturs anâ de crawlinâ anâ creepinâ
things wuz lots bigger dan what dey is now. Dey had bigger houses, ef
dey had any âtall, anâ ef dey had bigger houses dey must âaâ had bigger
chimbleys.

âSo den, all dat beinâ settleâ, Iâm gwine tell yoâ âbout olâ Grandaddy
Cricket. He must âaâ been a grandaddy long âbout de time dat my
great-grandaddyâs great-grandaddy wuz workinâ for his great-grandaddy.
Howsomever dat mought be, olâ Grandaddy Cricket wuz on hanâ, anâ fum
all I hear he wuz bigger dan a middlinâ-size goat. All endurinâ er de
hot weather, heâd stay out in de woods wid his fife anâ his fiddle,
anâ I speck he had great times. One day heâd fiddle fer de fishes fer
ter dance, anâ de nexâ heâd lâarn de young birds how ter whistle wid
his fife. Day in anâ day out he frolicked anâ had his fun, but bimeby
de weather âgun ter git cool anâ de days âgun ter git shorter, anâ olâ
Grandaddy Cricket hatter keep his hanâs in his pockets fum soon in de
morninâ twel ten oâclock. Anâ âlong âbout de time when de sun start
down hill, heâd hatter put his fiddle under his arm anâ his fife in his
side-pocket.

âDis wuz bad nuff, but wuss come. It got so colâ dat Grandaddy Cricket
canât skacely walk twel de sun wuz shininâ right over âim. Moâ dan dat,
he âgun ter git hongry and stay hongry. Ef yuâd âaâ seed âim in de hot
weather, fiddlinâ anâ dancinâ, anâ fifinâ anâ prancinâ, youâd âaâ thunk
dat he had a stack er vittles put by ez big ez de barn back yander; but
bimeby it got so cold dat he know sumpân got ter be done. He know sumpân
got ter be done, but how er when he couldnât âaâ tolâ you ef it had âaâ
been de lasâ acâ. He went âlong, creepinâ anâ crawlinâ fum post ter
pillar, anâ he âmembered de days when he went wid a hop, skip anâ a jump,
but he wuz too colâ fer ter cry.

âHe crope along, tryinâ ter keep on de sunny side er de worlâ, twel
bimeby, one day he seed smoke a-risinâ way off yander, anâ he knowâd
mighty well dat whar derâs smoke dey bleeze ter be fire. He crope anâ
he crawled, anâ bimeby he come close nuff ter de smoke fer ter see dat
it wuz cominâ outân a chimbley datâd been built on one âeen uv a house.
âTwant like de houses what you see up yander in Atlanty, kaze âtwuz made
out er logs, anâ de chink âtwixâ de logs wuz stopped up wid red clay. De
chimbley wuz made outân sticks anâ stones anâ mud.

âGrandaddy Cricket wuz forty-levâm times bigger dan what his fambly
is deze days, but he wanât so big dat he couldnât crawl unâ de house,
kaze âtwuz propped up on pillars. So unâ de house he went anâ scrouge
close ter de chimbley fer ter see ef he canât git some er de warmf, but,
bless you, it âuz stone colâ. Ef it had âaâ been like de chimbleys is
deze days, olâ Grandaddy Cricket would âaâ friz stiff, but âtwuz plain,
eveâyday mud plastered on some sticks laid crossways. âTwuz hard fer olâ
Grandaddy Cricket fer ter work his way inter de chimbley, but harder fer
ter stay out ân de colâ--so he sot in ter work. He gnyawed anâ he sawed,
he scratched anâ he clawed, he pushed anâ he gouged, anâ he shoved anâ he
scrouged, twel, bimeby, he got whar he could feel some er de warmf er de
fire, anâ âtwant long âfoâ he wuz feelinâ fine. He snickered ter hisseâf
when he hear de winâ whistlinâ rounâ de cornders, anâ blowinâ des like it
come right fresh fum de place whar de ice-bugs live at.â

The little boy laughed and placed his hand caressingly on Uncle Remusâs
knee. âYou mean ice-bergs, Uncle Remus,â he said.

âNigh ez I kin âmember,â replied the old darky, with affected dignity,
âice-bugs is what I meant. I tell you dat pâintedly. What I know âbout
ice-berrigs?â

The little lad eyed the old darky curiously, but said nothing more
for some time. Uncle Remus regarded him from the corner of his eye and
smiled, for this was a little chap whose ways he was yet to understand.
Finally, he took up the thread of his story. âItâs des like I tell you,
honey; he ainât no sooner git thawed out dan he âgun ter feel good. Dey
wuz some cracks anâ crannies in de hâath er de fireplace, anâ when de
chillun eat der mush anâ milk, some er de crumâs âud sift thoo de hâath.
Olâ Grandaddy Cricket smelt um, anâ felt um, anâ helt um, anâ atter dat
you couldnât make âim bâlieve dat he wanât in hog-heavâm.

âDe place whar he wuz at waânât roomy nuff fer fiddlinâ, but he tuck out
his fife anâ âgun ter play on it, anâ evây time he hear a noise heâd cut
de chune short. Heâd blow a little anâ den break off, but take de day
ez it come, he put in a right smart lot er fifinâ. When night come, anâ
evâything wuz dark down dar whar he wuz at, he des turned hisseâf loose.
De chillun in de house, dey des lisâen anâ laugh, but dey daddy shake
his head anâ look sour. Dey wanât no crickets in de country whar he come
fum, anâ he wanât usen ter um. But de mammy er de chillun ainât pay no
âtention ter de fifinâ; she des went on âbout her business like dey ainât
no cricket in de rounâ worlâ. Olâ Grandaddy Cricket he fifed anâ fifed
des like he wuz doinâ it fer pay. He played de chillun off ter bed anâ
played um ter sleep; he played twel de olâ man got ter nid-nid-noddinâ
by de fire; he played twel dey all went ter bed âcepâ de mammy, anâ he
played whiles she sot by de hâath, anâ dremp âbout de times when she wuz
a gal--de olâ times dat make de granâ-chillun feel so funny when dey hear
tell âbout um.

âNight atter night de fifinâ went on, anâ bimeby de man âgun ter git
tired. De âoman, she say dat de crickets brung good luck, but de man, he
say heâd druther have moâ luck anâ less fifinâ. So he holler down thoo de
crack in de hâath, anâ tell olâ Grandaddy Cricket fer ter hush his fuss
er change his chune. But de fifinâ went on. De man holler down anâ say
dat ef de fifinâ donât stop, he gwine ter pour bâilinâ water on de fifer.
Olâ Grandaddy Cricket holler back:

    _ââHot water will turn me brown,_
    _Anâ den Iâll kick yoâ chimbley down.â_

[Illustration: â_So he holler down thoo de crack_â]

âDe man, he grin, he did, anâ den he put de kittle on de fire anâ kepâ
it dar twel de water âgun ter bâile, anâ den, whiles de fifinâ wuz at
de loudest, he tuck de kittle anâ tilted it so de scaldinâ water will
run down thoo de cracks, anâ den de fust thing he knowâd he ainât know
nothinâ, kaze de water weakened de clay anâ de hâath fell in anâ olâ
Grandaddy Cricket sot in ter kickinâ anâ de chimbley come down, it
did, anâ bury de man, anâ when dey got âim out, he wuz one-eyed anâ
splay-footed.

âDe âoman anâ de chillun ainât skacely know âim. Dey hatter ax âim his
name, anâ whar he come fum, anâ how olâ he wuz; anâ atter he satchified
um dat he wuz de same man what been livinâ dar all de time, de âoman say,
âAinât I tell you dat crickets fetch good luck?â Anâ de man, he âlow,
âDoes you call dis good luck?ââ

âWhat became of the cricket?â asked the little boy, after a long pause,
during which Uncle Remus appeared to be thinking about other things.

âOh!â exclaimed the old darky. âDatâs so! I ainât tolâ you, is I?
Well, olâ Grandaddy Cricket kicked so hard, anâ kicked so high, dat he
onjâinted bofe his legs, anâ when he crawled out fum de chimbley, his
elbows wuz whar his knees oughter be at.â

âBut it was cold weather,â suggested the little boy. âWhere did he go
when he kicked the chimney down?â

Uncle Remus smiled as he took another chew of tobacco. âDey waânât but
one thing he could do,â he replied; âhe went on ter nexâ house anâ got in
de chimbley anâ he been livinâ in chimbleys off anâ on down ter dis day
anâ time.â

HOW WILEY WOLF RODE IN THE BAG


Uncle Remus soon had the wagon loaded with corn, and he and the little
boy started back home. The plantation road was not a good one to begin
with, and the spring rains had not improved it. Consequently there were
times when Uncle Remus deemed it prudent to get out of the wagon and
walk. The horses were fat and strong, to be sure, but some of the small
hills were very steep, so much so that the old darky had to guide the
team first to the right and then to the left in order to overcome the
sheer grade. In other words, he had to see-saw as he explained to the
little boy. âDrive um straight up, anâ dey fall back,â he explained, âbut
on de see-saw dey fergits dat deyer gwine uphill.â

All this was Dutch to the little boy, who knew nothing about driving
horses, but he had been well trained, and so he said, âYes, that is
so.â The last time that Uncle Remus had to vacate the driverâs seat in
order to relieve the horses of his weight, he stumbled into a ditch that
had been dug on the side of the road to prevent the rains from washing
it into gullies. He recovered himself immediately, but not before he
had startled a little rabbit, which ran on ahead of the horses for a
considerable distance. Instinct came to its aid after a while, and it
darted into the underbrush which grew profusely on both sides of the road.

Before the little rabbit disappeared, however, Uncle Remus had time to
give utterance to a hunting halloo that aroused the echoes all around and
made the little boy jump, for he was not used to this sort of thing. âI
declarâ ter gracious ef it donât put me in minâ er olâ times--de times
dey tell âbout in de tales dat been handed down. Ef dat little rab had
âaâ been five times ez big ez he is, anâ twice ez young, Iâd âaâ thunk
weâd done got back ter de days when my great-grandaddyâs great-grandaddy
lived. You maynât bâlieve me, but ef youâll count fum de time when my
great-grandaddyâs great-grandaddy wuz bornâd down ter dis minnit, youâll
finâ dat youer lookinâ back on many a long year, anâ a mighty heap er
Chrisâmus-come-anâ-gone.

âYou may think dat deze times is de besâ; well, den, you kin have um ef
youâll des giâ me de olâ times when de nights wuz long anâ de days short,
wid plenty er wood on de fire, anâ taters anâ ashcake in de embers. Hanâ
um here!â Uncle Remus held out his hand as if he thought the little
chap had the old times and the ashcakes and the roasted potatoes in his
pocket. âDen you ainât got um,â he went on, as the child drew away and
pretended to hold his pocket tight; âyou ainât got um, anâ you canât git
um. I done been had um, but I got ter nippy-nappinâ one night, anâ some
un come âlong anâ tuck um--some nigger man, I speck, kaze dey wuz a big
fat âpossum mixed up wid um, anâ a heap er yuther things liable fer ter
make a niggerâs mouf water. Yasser! dey tuck um right away fum me, anâ I
ainât seed um sence; anâ maybe ef I wuz ter see um I wouldnât know um.â

âWere the rabbits very large in old times?â inquired the little boy.

âDey mought er been runts in de fambly,â replied Uncle Remus cautiously,
âbut fum all I kin hear fum dem what knowâd, olâ Brer Rabbit wuz a sight
bigger dan any er de rabbits you see deze days.â

Uncle Remus paused to give the little boy an opportunity to make some
comment, or ask such questions as occurred to him, as the other little
boy had been so ready to do; but he said nothing. It seemed that his
curiosity had been satisfied, and yet he wanted very much to hear a story
such as Uncle Remus had been in the habit of telling his father when he
was the little boy. But he had been so rigidly trained to silence in the
presence of his elders that he hesitated about making his desires known.

The old negro, however, was so accustomed to anticipating the wants of
children, especially those in whom he took an interest, that he knew
perfectly well what the little boy wanted. The childâs attitude was
expectant, even if his lips refused to give form to his thoughts. This
sort of thing--the old negro could give it no name--was so new to Uncle
Remus that he chuckled, and presently the chuckle developed into a hearty
laugh.

The little boy regarded him with surprise. âAre you laughing at me, Uncle
Remus?â he inquired, after some hesitation.

âWhy, honey, what put dat idee in yoâ head? What I gwineter laugh at you
fer? Ef you wuz a little bigger, I might laugh at you, des ter see how
youâd take it. Ef you want me ter laugh at you, youâll hatter do some
growinâ.â

âGrandmother says Iâm a big boy,â said the child.

âFer yoâ age anâ size, youer right smart chunk uv a boy,â assented Uncle
Remus, âbut youâll hatter be lots bigger dan what you is âfoâ I laugh
at you. No, suh; I wuz gigglinâ at de way Brer Rabbit got away wid olâ
Brer Wolf endurinâ er de time when der chillun played tergedder; anâ
dat little rabbit dat run âcross de road put me in minâ un it. I bet ef
Iâd âaâ been dar, Iâd âaâ done moâ dan laugh--Iâd âaâ hollerâd. Yasser,
dey ainât no two ways âbout it--Iâd âaâ des flung back my head anâ âaâ
fetched a whoop dat you could âaâ hearn fum here ter de big house. Datâs
what Iâd âaâ done.â

âIt must have been very funny, then,â remarked the little boy.

Uncle Remus looked at the child with a serious face. Surely something
must be wrong with him. And yet he was still expectant--expectant and
patient. The old negro had never had dealings with such a youngster as
this, and he was not in the habit of telling stories âdes dry so,â as he
put it; so he went at it in a new, but still a characteristic, way. âEf
yoâ pa had âaâ been settinâ wha you settinâ he wouldnât giâ me no peace
twel I tolâ âim zackly what I wuz laughinâ âbout; anâ heâd âaâ pestered
me wid his inquirements twel he founâ out all about it. Does he pester
you dat a-way, honey? Kaze ef he does, Iâll tell you de way ter fetch âim
up wid a rounâ turn; des tell âim you gwineter tell his mammy on him, anâ
I bet you he wonât pester you much atter dat.â

This tickled the little boy very much. The idea of asking his grandmother
to make his father stop bothering him was so new and so ridiculous that
he laughed unrestrainedly.

âDe minnit dat little rab jumped outân de bushes,â Uncle Remus went
on, apparently paying no attention to the childâs laughter, âit put
me in minâ er de time when olâ Brer Rabbit had a lot er chillun anâ
granâchillun pirootinâ rounâ de neighborhoods whar he live at. Dey mought
âaâ not been any granâchillun in de bunch, but dey wuz plenty er chillun,
bofe young anâ olâ.

âBrer Rabbit âud move sometimes des like de folks does deze days,
speshually up dar in âLantmatantarum, whar you come fum.â The little boy
smiled at this new name for Atlanta, and snuggled a little closer to
Uncle Remus, for the old man had, with this one word, entered the fields
that belong to childhood. âHeâd move, but mosâ allers heâd take a notion
fer ter come back ter his olâ home. Sometimes he hatter move, de yuther
creeturs pursued atter âim so close, but dey allers got de ragged enâ er
de pursuinâ, anâ dey wuz times when deyâd be right neighborly wid âim.

ââTwuz âbout de time dat Brer Wolf had kinder made up his minâ dat he
canât outdo Brer Rabbit, no way he kin fix it, anâ he say ter hisseâf dat
he better let âim âlone twel he kin git âim in a corner whar he canât
git out. So Brer Wolf, he live wid his fambly on one side de road, anâ
Brer Rabbit live wid his fambly on de yuther side, not close nuff fer ter
quoil âbout de fence line, anâ yit close nuff fer der youngest chillun
ter play tergedder whiles de olâ folks wuz payinâ der Sunday calls.

[Illustration: â_Dey sot dar â¦ talkinâ âbout olâ times_â]

âIt went on anâ went on dis way twel it look like Brer Rabbit done
fergit how ter play tricks on his neighbors anâ Brer Wolf done
disrememberâd dat he yever is try fer ter ketch Brer Rabbit fer meat fer
his fambly. One Sunday in speshual, dey wuz mighty frienâly. It wuz Brer
Rabbitâs time fer ter call on Brer Wolf, anâ bofe un um wuz settinâ up in
de porch des ez natchal ez life. Brer Rabbit wuz chawinâ his terbacker
anâ spittinâ over de railinâ anâ Brer Wolf wuz grinninâ âbout olâ times,
anâ pickinâ his toofies, which dey look mighty white anâ sharp. Dey wuz
settinâ up dar, dey wuz, des ez thick ez fleas on a dogâs back, anâ
lookinâ like butter wonât melt in der mouf.

âAnâ whiles dey wuz settinâ dar, little Wiley Wolf anâ Riley Rabbit wuz
playinâ in de yard des like chillun will. Dey run anâ dey romped, dey
frisk anâ dey frolic, dey jump anâ dey hump, dey hide anâ dey slide, anâ
it look like dey had moâ fun dan a mule kin pull in a waggin. Little
Wiley Wolf, heâd run atter Riley Rabbit, anâ den Riley Rabbit âud run
atter Wiley Wolf, anâ here dey had it up anâ down anâ rounâ anâ rounâ,
twel it look like deyâd run deyseâf ter death. âBout de time youâd think
dey bleeze ter drap, one un um would holler out, âKingâs Excuse!â anâ
in dem days, when you say dat, nobody canât ketch you, it ainât make no
diffunce who, kaze ef dey dast ter lay hanâs on you atter you say dat,
dey could be tuck ter de place whar dey done der judginâ, an ef dey
waânât mighty sharp deyâd git put in jail.

âNow, whiles Wiley Wolf anâ Riley Rabbit wuz havinâ der fun, der daddies
wuz bleeze ter hear de racket what dey make, anâ see de dusâ dey raise.
Dey squealed anâ dey squalled, anâ ripped arounâ twel youâd a thunk dey
wuz a good size whirlywinâ blowinâ in de yard. Brer Rabbit chawâd his
terbacker right slow anâ shot one eye, anâ olâ Brer Wolf lick his chops
anâ grin. Brer Rabbit âlow, âDe youngsters is gittinâ mighty familious,â
anâ ol Brer Wolf say, âDey is indeedy, anâ I hope deyâll keep it up. You
know how we useter be, Brer Rabbit; we wuz constant a-playinâ tricks
on one anâer, anâ it lookt like we wuz allers at outs. I hope de young
unsâll have better manners!â

âDey sot dar, dey did, talkinâ âbout olâ times, twel de sun got low,
anâ de visitinâ had ter be cut short. Brer Rabbit say dat he had ter cut
some kindlinâ so his olâ âoman kin git supper, anâ Brer Wolf âlow dat he
allers cut his kindlinâ on Satâday so he kin have all Sunday ter hisseâf,
anâ smoke his pipe in peace. He went a piece er de way wid Brer Rabbit,
anâ Wiley Wolf, he come, too, anâ him anâ Riley Rabbit had all sorts uv
a time atter dey got in de big road. Dey wuz bushes on bofe sides, anâ
dey kepâ up der game er hide anâ seek des ez fur ez Brer Wolf went, but
bimeby, he say he gone fur nuff, anâ he say he hope Brer Rabbitâll come
agâin right soon, anâ let Riley come anâ play wid Wiley endurinâ er de
week.

âNot ter be outdone, Brer Rabbit invite Brer Wolf fer ter come anâ see
him, anâ likewise ter let Wiley come anâ play wid Riley. âDey ainât
nothinâ but chillun,â sezee, âanâ look like dey done tuck a likinâ ter
one anâer.â

âOn de way back home, Brer Wolf make a mighty strong talk ter Wiley. He
say, âItâs moâ dan likely dat de little Rab will come ter play wid you
some day when dey ainât nobody here, anâ when he do, I want you ter play
de game er ridinâ in de bag.â Wiley Wolf say he ainât never hear tell er
dat game, anâ olâ Brer Wolf say itâs easy ez fallinâ off a log. âYou git
in de bag,â sezee, âanâ let âim haul you rounâ de yard, anâ den heâll git
in de bag fer you ter haul him ârounâ. What you wanter do is ter git âim
use ter de bag; you hear dat, donât you? Git âim use ter de bag.â

âSo when little Riley come, de two un um had a great time er ridinâ in
de bag; âtwuz des like ridinâ in a waggin, âceppinâ dat Riley Rabbit
look like he ainât got no moâ sense dan ter haul little Wiley Wolf over
de roughest grounâ he kin finâ, anâ when Wiley hollerâd dat he hurt âim,
Riley âud say he wonât do it no moâ, but de nexâ chance he got, heâd do
it agâin.

[Illustration: ââ_Git âim use to de bag!_ââ]

âWell, dey had all sorts uv a time, anâ when Riley Rabbit went home,
he up anâ tolâ um all what deyâd been a-playinâ. Brer Rabbit ainât say
nothinâ; he des sot dar, he did, anâ chaw his terbacker, anâ shot one
eye. Anâ when olâ Brer Wolf come home dat night, Wiley tolâ âim âbout de
good time deyâd had. Brer Wolf grin, he did, anâ lick his chops. He say,
sezee, âDeyâs two parts ter dat game. When you git tired er ridinâ in de
bag, you tie de bag.â He went on, he did, anâ tolâ Wiley dat what he want
âim ter do is ter play ridinâ in de bag twel bofe got tired, anâ den play
tyinâ de bag, anâ at de lasâ he wuz ter tie de bag so little Riley Rabbit
canât git out, anâ den ter go ter bed anâ kiver up his head.

âSo said, so done. Little Riley Rabbit come anâ played ridinâ in de bag,
anâ den when dey got tired, dey played tyinâ de bag. âTwuz mighty funny
fer ter tie one anâer in de bag, anâ not know ef twuz gwineter be ontied.
I dunner what would âaâ happen ter little Riley Rab ef olâ Brer Rabbit
ainât come along wid a big load er âspicions. He call de little Rabbit
ter de fence. He talk loud anâ he say dat he want âim fer ter fetch a
turn er kindlinâ when he start home, anâ den he say ter Riley, âBe tied
in de bag once moâ, anâ den when Wiley gits in tie âim in dar hard anâ
fasâ. Wet de string in yoâ mouf, anâ pull it des ez tight ez you kin. Den
you come on home; yoâ mammy want you.â

âDe lasâ time Wiley Wolf got in de bag, little Riley tied it so tight
dat he couldnât âaâ got it loose ef heâd âaâ tried. He tied it tight, he
did, anâ den he âlow, âI got ter go home fer ter git some kindlinâ, anâ
when I do dat, Iâll come back anâ play twel supper-time.â But ef he yever
is went back dar, I ainât never hear talk un it.â

Uncle Remus closed his eyes apparently, but not so tight that he
couldnât watch the little boy. The youngster had been listening to the
story too intently to ask questions, and now he sat silent waiting for
Uncle Remus to finish. He waited and waited until he grew impatient, and
then he raised his head. He still waited a few moments longer, but Uncle
Remus to all appearances was nodding. âUncle Remus,â he cried, âwhat
became of Wiley Wolf?â

[Illustration: ââ_Den you come on home; yoâ mammy want you_ââ]

The old negro pretended to wake with a start. âAinât I hear some un
talkinâ?â He looked all around, and then his eye fell on the little boy.
âDar you is!â he exclaimed with a laugh. âI done been ter sleep anâ
drempt dat I wuz eatinâ a slishe er tater custard ez big ez de waggin
body.â The little boy repeated his question, whereupon Uncle Remus held
up his hands with a gesture of astonishment. âAinât I tolâ you dat? Den I
musâ be gittinâ olâ anâ wobbly. De fusâ thing when I git ter de house Iâm
gwineter be weighed fer ter see how olâ I is. Now, whar wuz I at?â

âWiley Wolf was in the bag,â the little boy answered.

âAh-h-h! Right whar Riley Rab lefâ âim. He wuz in de bag anâ dar he
stayed twel olâ Brer Wolf come fum whar he been workinâ in de fielâ--de
creeturs wuz mosâly farmers in dem days. He come back, he did, anâ he see
de bag, anâ he know by de bulk un it dat dey wuz sumpân in it, anâ he âuz
so greedy dat his mouf fair dribbled. Now, den, when Wiley Wolf got in
de bag, he wuz mighty tired. Heâd been a-scufflinâ an a-rastlinâ twel he
wuz plumâ woâ out. He hear Riley Rab say he wuz cominâ back, anâ while he
wuz waitinâ, he drapt off ter sleep, anâ dar he wuz when his daddy come
home--sounâ asleep.

âOlâ Brer Wolf ainât got but one idee, anâ dat wuz dat Riley Rab wuz in
de bag, so he went ter de winder, anâ ax ef de pot wuz bâilinâ, anâ his
olâ âoman say âtwuz. Wid dat, he pick up de bag, anâ foâ you could bat
yoâ eye, he had it soused in de pot.â

âIn the boiling water!â exclaimed the child.

âDatâs de way de tale runs,â replied Uncle Remus. âEz dey gun it ter me,
so I gin it to you.â




III

BROTHER RABBITâS LAUGHING-PLACE


This new little boy was intensely practical. He had imagination, but it
was unaccompanied by any of the ancient illusions that make the memory
of childhood so delightful. Young as he was he had a contempt for those
who believed in Santa Claus. He believed only in things that his mother
considered valid and vital, and his training had been of such a character
as to leave out all the beautiful romances of childhood.

Thus when Uncle Remus mentioned something about Brother Rabbitâs
laughing-place, he pictured it forth in his mind as a sure-enough place
that the four-footed creatures had found necessary for their comfort and
convenience. This way of looking at things was, in some measure, a great
help; it cut off long explanations, and stopped many an embarrassing
question.

On one occasion when the two were together, the little boy referred to
Brother Rabbitâs laughing-place and talked about it in much the same way
that he would have talked about Atlanta. If Uncle Remus was unprepared
for such literalness he displayed no astonishment, and for all the child
knew, he had talked the matter over with hundreds of other little boys.

âUncle Remus,â said the lad, âwhen was the last time you went to Brother
Rabbitâs laughing-place?â

âTo tell you de trufe, honey, I dunno ez I ever been dar,â the old man
responded.

âNow, I think that is very queer,â remarked the little boy.

Uncle Remus reflected a moment before committing himself. âI dunno ez
I yever went right spang ter de place anâ put my hanâ on it. I speck
I could âaâ gone dar wid mighty little trouble, but I wuz so use ter
hearinâ âbout it dat de idee er gwine dar ainât never got in my head.
Itâs sorter like olâ Mr. Grissomâs house. Dey say he lives in a quare
little shanty not fur fum de mill. I know right whar de shanty is, yit I
ainât never been dar, anâ I ainât never seed it.

âItâs de same way wid Brer Rabbitâs laughinâ-place. Dem what tolâ me
âbout it had likely been dar, but I ainât never had no âcasion fer ter
go dar myseâf. Yit ef I could walk fifteen er sixty mile a day, like I
useter, I bounâ you I could go right now anâ put my hanâ on de place. Dey
wuz one time--but datâs a tale, anâ, goodness knows, you done hear nuff
tales er one kinâ anâ anudder fer ter make a hoss sick--dey ainât no two
ways âbout dat.â

Uncle Remus paused and sighed, and then closed his eyes with a groan,
as though he were sadly exercised in spirit; but his eyes were not
shut so tight that he could not observe the face of the child. It was
a prematurely grave little face that the old man saw and whether this
was the result of the youngsterâs environment, or his training, or his
temperament, it would have been difficult to say. But there it was, the
gravity that was only infrequently disturbed by laughter. Uncle Remus
perhaps had seen more laughter in that little face than any one else.
Occasionally the things that the child laughed at were those that would
have convulsed other children, but more frequently, as it seemed, his
smiles were the result of his own reflections and mental comparisons.

âI tell you what, honey,â said Uncle Remus, opening wide his eyes, âdatâs
de veây thing you oughter have.â

âWhat is it?â the child inquired, though apparently he had no interest in
the matter.

âWhat you want is a laughinâ-place, whar you kin go anâ tickle
yoâseâf anâ laugh whedder you wanter laugh er no. I bounâ ef you had
a laughinâ-place, youâd gain flesh, anâ when yoâ pa comes down fum
âLantamatantarum, he wouldnât skacely know you.â

âBut I donât want father not to know me,â the child answered. âIf he
didnât know me, I should feel as if I were some one else.â

âOh, heâd know you bimeby,â said Uncle Remus, âanâ heâd be all de
gladder fer ter see you lookinâ like somebody.â

âDo I look like nobody?â asked the little boy.

âWhen you fust come down here,â Uncle Remus answered, âyou look like
nothinâ âtall, but sence you been ramblinâ rounâ wid me, you done âgun
ter look like somebody--mosâ like um.â

âI reckon thatâs because I have a laughing-place,â said the child. âYou
didnât know I had one, did you? I have one, but you are the first person
in the world that I have told about it.â

âWell, suh!â Uncle Remus exclaimed with well-feigned astonishment;
âanâ you been settinâ here lisâninâ at me, anâ all de time you got
a laughinâ-place er yoâ own! I never would âaâ bâlieved it uv you.
Wharbouts is dish yer place?â

âIt is right here where you are,â said the little boy with a winning
smile.

âHoney, you donât tell me!â exclaimed the old man, looking all around.
âEf you kin see it, you see moâ dan I does--dey ainât no two ways âbout
dat.â

âWhy, you are my laughing-place,â cried the little lad with an
extraordinary burst of enthusiasm.

âWell, I thank my stars!â said Uncle Remus with emotion. âYou shoâ does
need ter laugh lots moâ dan what you does. But what make you laugh at
me, honey? Is my britches too big, er is I too big fer my britches? You
neenâter laugh at dis coat, kaze itâs one dat yoâ grandaddy useter have.
Itâs mighty nigh new, kaze I ainât woâd it moâ dan âlevâm year. It may
look shiny in places, but when you see a coat look shiny, itâs a sign
dat itâs des ez good ez new. You canât laugh at my shoes, kaze I made
um myseâf, anâ ef dey lack shape datâs kaze I made um fer ter fit my
rheumatism anâ my foots bofe.â

âWhy, I never laughed at you!â exclaimed the child, blushing at the very
idea. âI laugh at what you say, and at the stories you tell.â

âLa, honey! You shoâ dunno nothinâ; you oughter hearn me tell tales
when I could tell um. I bounâ youâd âaâ busted de buttons offân yoâ
whatchermacollums. Yoâ pa useter set right whar you er settinâ anâ laugh
twel he canât laugh no moâ. But dem wuz laughinâ times, anâ it look like
dey ainât never cominâ back. Dat âuz âfoâ eveâybody wuz rushinâ rounâ
trying fer ter git money what donât bâlong ter um by good rights.â

âI was thinking to myself,â remarked the child, âthat if Brother Rabbit
had a laughing-place I had a better one.â

âHoney, hush!â exclaimed Uncle Remus with a laugh. âYouâll have me gwine
rounâ here wid my head in de aâr, anâ feelinâ so biggity dat I wonât look
at my own seâf in de lookinâ-glass. I ainât too olâ fer dat kinder talk
ter spâile me.â

âDidnât you say there was a tale about Brother Rabbitâs laughing-place?â
inquired the little boy, when Uncle Remus ceased to admire himself.

âI dunner whedder you kin call it a tale,â replied the old man. âItâs
mighty funny âbout tales,â he went on. âTell um ez you may anâ whence you
may, someâll say tainât no tale, anâ den agâin someâll say dat itâs a
fine tale. Dey ainât no tellinâ. Dat de reason I donât like ter tell no
tale ter grown folks, speshually ef dey er white folks. Deyâll take it
anâ put it by de side er some yuther tale what dey got in der minâ anâ
deyâll take on dat slonchidickler grin what allers say, âGo way, nigger
man! You dunner what a tale is!â Anâ I donât--Iâll say dat much fer ter
keep some un else fum sayinâ it.

âNow, âbout dat laughinâ-place--it seem like dat one time de creeturs got
ter âsputinâ âmongsâ deyselves ez ter which un kin laugh de loudest. One
word fotch on anâer twel it look like dey wuz gwineter be a free fight, a
rumpus anâ a riot. Dey showâd der claws anâ tushes, anâ shuck der horns,
anâ rattle der hoof. Dey had der bristles up, anâ it look like der eyes
wuz runninâ blood, dey got so red.

âDes âbout de time when it look like you canât keep um âpart, little
Miss Squinch Owl flewâd up a tree anâ âlow, âYou all dunner what laughinâ
is--ha-ha-ha-ha! You canât laugh when you try ter laugh--ha-ha-ha-haha!â
De creeturs wuz âstonisht. Here wuz a little fowl not much bigger dan
a jay-bird laughinâ herseâf blinâ when dey waânât a thing in de rounâ
worlâ fer ter laugh at. Dey stop der quoilinâ atter dat anâ look at one
anâer. Brer Bull say, âIs anybody ever hear de beat er dat? Who mought
de lady be?â Dey all say dey dunno, anâ dey got a mighty good reason fer
der sesso, kaze Miss Squinch Owl, she flies at night wid de bats anâ de
Betsey Bugs.

âWell, dey quit der quoilinâ, de creeturs did, but dey still had der
âspute; de cominâ er Miss Squinch Owl ainât settle dat. So dey âgree
dat deyâd meet someârs when de wedder got better, anâ try der hanâ at
laughinâ fer ter see which un kin outdo de yuther.â Observing that the
little boy was laughing very heartily, Uncle Remus paused long enough to
inquire what had hit him on his funny-bone.

âI was laughing because you said the animals were going to meet anâ try
their hand at laughing,â replied the lad when he could get breath enough
to talk.

Uncle Remus regarded the child with a benevolent smile of admiration.
âYouer long ways ahead er me--you shoâ is. Dey ainât naâer nâer chap in
de worlâ whatâd âaâ cotch on so quick. You put me in minâ er de peerch,
what grab de bait âfoâ it hit de water. Well, datâs what de creeturs
done. Dey say dey wuz gwineter make trial fer ter see which un is de
out-laughinâest er de whole caboodle, anâ dey name de day, anâ all
prommus fer ter be dar, ceppinâ Brer Rabbit, anâ he âlow dat he kin laugh
well nuff fer ter suit hisseâf anâ his fambly, âsides dat, he donât keer
âbout laughinâ lessân deyâs sumpân fer ter laugh at. De yuther creeturs
dey beg âim fer ter come, but he shake his head anâ wiggle his mustache,
anâ say dat when he wanter laugh, he got a laughinâ-place fer ter go ter,
whar he wonât be pestered by de balance er creation. He say he kin go
dar anâ laugh his fill, anâ den go on âbout his business, ef he got any
business, anâ ef he ainât got none, he kin go ter play.

[Illustration: ââ_Gracious me!â anâ den he howl_â]

âDe yuther creeturs ainât know what ter make er all dis, anâ dey wonder
anâ wonder how Brer Rabbit kin have a laughinâ-place anâ dey ainât got
none. When dey ax âim âbout it, he âsponâ, he did, dat he speck âtwuz des
de diffunce âtwix one creetur anâ anâer. He ax um fer ter look at folks,
how diffunt dey wuz, let âlone de creeturs. One man âd be rich anâ anâer
man poâ, anâ he ax how come dat.

âWell, suh, dey des natchally canât tell âim what make de diffunce âtwix
folks no moâ dan dey kin tell âim de diffunce âtwixâ de creeturs. Dey
wuz stumped; dey done fergit all âbout de trial what wuz ter come off,
but Brer Rabbit fotch um back ter it. He say dey ainât no needs fer ter
see which kin outdo all de balance un um in de laughinâ business, kaze
anybody what got any sense know dat de donkey is a natchal laugher, same
as Brer Coon is a natchal pacer.

âBrer Bâar look at Brer Wolf, anâ Brer Wolf look at Brer Fox, anâ den
dey all look at one anâer. Brer Bull, he say, âWell, well, well!â anâ den
he groan; Brer Bâar say, âWhoâd âaâ thunk it?â anâ den he growl; anâ Brer
Wolf say âGracious me!â anâ den he howl. Atter dat, dey ainât say much,
kaze dey ainât much fer ter say. Dey des stanâ rounâ anâ look kinder
sheepish. Dey ainât âspute wid Brer Rabbit, dough deyâd âaâ like ter âaâ
done it, but dey sot about anâ make marks in de sanâ des like you see
folks do when deyer tryinâ fer ter git der thinkinâ machine ter work.

[Illustration: â_Brer Rabbit he put his hanâ ter his head_â]

âWell, suh, dar dey sot anâ dar dey stood. Dey ax Brer Rabbit how
he know how ter finâ his laughinâ-place, anâ how he know it wuz a
laughinâ-place atter he got dar. He tap hisseâf on de head, he did, anâ
âlow dat dey wuz a heap moâ undâ his hat dan what you could git out wid a
fine-toof comb. Den dey ax ef dey kin see his laughinâ-place, anâ he say
heâd take de idee ter bed wid âim, anâ study âpon it, but he kin say dis
much right den, dat if he did let um see it, deyâd hatter go dar one at
a time, anâ deyâd hatter do des like he say; ef dey donât deyâll git de
notion dat itâs a cryinâ-place.

âDey âgree ter dis, de creeturs did, anâ den Brer Rabbit say dat while
deyer all der tergedder, dey better choosen âmongsâ deyseâf which un
uv um wuz gwine fusâ, anâ heâd choosen de resâ when de time come. Dey
jowered anâ jowered, anâ bimeby, dey hatter leave it all ter Brer Rabbit.
Brer Rabbit, he put his hanâ ter his head, anâ shot his eyeballs anâ do
like he studyinâ. He say âDe moâ I think âbout who shill be de fusâ one,
de moâ I git de idee dat it oughter be Brer Fox. He been here long ez
anybody, anâ heâs purty well thunk uv by de neighbors--I ainât never hear
nobody breave a breff agâin âim.â

âDey all say dat dey had Brer Fox in minâ all de time, but somehow dey
canât come right out wid his name, anâ dey vow dat ef dey had âgreed on
somebody, dat somebody would shoâ âaâ been Brer Fox. Den, atter dat,
âtwuz all plain sailinâ. Brer Rabbit say heâd meet Brer Fox at sech anâ
sech a place, at sech anâ sech a time, anâ atter dat dey waânât no moâ
ter be said. De creeturs all went ter de place whar dey live at, anâ done
des like dey allers done.

[Illustration: â_De creeturs all went ter de place whar dey live at_â]

âBrer Rabbit make a soon start fer ter go ter de pâint whar he prommus
ter met Brer Fox, but soon ez he wuz, Brer Fox wuz dar befoâ âim. It seem
like he wuz so much in de habits er beinâ outdone by Brer Rabbit dat he
canât do widout it. Brer Rabbit bow, he did, anâ pass de time er day wid
Brer Fox, anâ ax âim how his fambly wuz. Brer Fox say dey wuz peart ez
kin be, anâ den he âlow dat he ready anâ a-waitinâ fer ter go anâ see dat
great laughinâ-place what Brer Rabbit been talkinâ âbout.

âBrer Rabbit say dat suit him ter a gnatâs heel, anâ off dey put. Bimeby
dey come ter one er deze here cleâr places dat you sometimes see in
de middle uv a pine thicket. You may ax yoâseâf how come dey donât no
trees grow dar when deyâs trees all round, but you ainât gwineter git no
answer, anâ needer is dey anybody what kin tell you. Dey got dar, dey
did, anâ den Brer Rabbit make a halt. Brer Fox âlow, âIs dis de place? I
donât feel no moâ like laughinâ now dan I did âfoâ I come.â

[Illustration: â_But soon ez he wuz, Brer Fox wuz dar befoâ âim_â]

âBrer Rabbit, he say, âDes keep yoâ jacket on, Brer Fox; ef you git in

I tell you; ef you donât wanter laugh, Iâll des show you de place, anâ

ââEf you wanter projick, Brer Fox, youâll hatter go home anâ projick wid

You ax me fer ter show you my laughinâ-place, anâ I âgreed. I speck we

laughinâ-place, anâ he ainât gwineter be satchify twel he see it. Brer
Rabbit âlow dat ef dat de case, den he musâ acâ de gentermun all de
way thoo, anâ quit his behavishness. Brer Fox say heâll do de best he
kin, anâ den Brer Rabbit show âim a place whar de bamboo briars, anâ de
blackberry bushes, anâ de honeysuckles done start ter come in de pine
thicket, anâ canât come no furder. âTwaânât no thick place; âtwuz des
whar de swamp at de foot er de hill peterâd out in tryinâ ter come ter
dry lanâ. De bushes anâ vines wuz thin anâ scanty, anâ ef dey could âaâ
talked deyâd âaâ hollered loud fer water.

âBrer Rabbit show Brer Fox de place, anâ den tell âim dat de game is fer
ter run full tilt thoo de vines anâ bushes, anâ den run back, anâ thoo um
agâin anâ back, anâ he say heâd bet a plug er terbacker âgâin a ginger
cake dat by de time Brer Fox done dis heâd be dat tickled dat he canât
stanâ up fer laughinâ. Brer Fox shuck his head; he ainât nigh bâlieve it,
but fer all dat, he make up his minâ fer ter do what Brer Rabbit say,
spite er de fack dat his olâ âoman done tell im âfoâ he lefâ home dat he
better keep his eye open, kaze Brer Rabbit gwineter run a rig on âim.

[Illustration: â_His olâ âoman done tell him dat he better keep his eye

âHe tuck a runninâ start, he did, anâ he went thoo de bushes anâ de
vines like he wuz runninâ a race. He run anâ he come back a-runninâ, anâ
he run back, anâ dat time he struck sumpân wid his head. He try ter dodge
it, but he seed it too late, anâ he wuz gwine too fasâ. He struck it,
he did, anâ time he do dat, he fetched a howl dat you might âaâ hearn a
mile, anâ atter dat, he hollerâd yap, yap, yap, anâ ouch, ouch, ouch, anâ
yow, yow, yow, anâ whiles dis wuz gwine on Brer Rabbit wuz thumpinâ de
ground wid his behime foot, anâ laughinâ fit ter kill. Brer Fox run rounâ
anâ rounâ, anâ kepâ on snappinâ at hisseâf anâ doinâ like he wuz tryinâ

anâ fall, anâ squall twell it look like he wuz havinâ forty-levâm duck
fits.

[Illustration: â_Anâ dat time he struck sumpân wid his head_â]

âHe got still atter while, but de moâ stiller he got, de wuss he looked.
His head wuz all swell up, anâ he look like he been run over in de road
by a foâ-mule waggin. Brer Rabbit âlow, âIâm glad you had sech a good
time, Brer Fox; Iâll hatter fetch you out agâin. You shoâ done like you
wuz havinâ fun.â Brer Fox ainât say a word; he wuz too mad fer ter talk.
He des sot arounâ anâ lick hisseâf anâ try ter git his haâr straight.
Brer Rabbit âlow, âYou ripped arounâ in dar twel I wuz skeerâd you wuz

âBrer Fox show his tushes, anâ say, âYou said dis wuz a laughinâ-place.â
Brer Rabbit âlow, âI said âtwuz my laughinâ-place, anâ Iâll say it agâin.
What you reckon I been doinâ all dis time? Ainât you hear me laughinâ?
Anâ what you been doinâ? I hear you makinâ a mighty fuss in dar, anâ I

ââI let you know dat I ainât been laughinâ,â sez Brer Fox, sezee.â

Uncle Remus paused, and waited to be questioned. âWhat was the matter
with the Fox, if he wasnât laughing?â the child asked after a thoughtful
moment.

Uncle Remus flung his head back, and cried out in a sing-song tone,

    â_He run ter de Easâ an he run ter de Wesâ_
    _Anâ jammed his head in a hornetâs nesâ!_â




IV

BROTHER RABBIT AND THE CHICKENS


Uncle Remus was sorely puzzled as to the best method of pleasing this
youngster. He wasnât sure the little boy enjoyed such tales as the one
in which Riley Rabbit turned the tables on Wiley Wolf. So he ventured a
question. âHoney, what kinder tales does you like?â

âOh, I like them all,â replied the little boy, âonly some are nicer than
the others;â and then, without waiting for an invitation, he told Uncle
Remus the story of Cinderella. He told it very well for a small chap, and
Uncle Remus pretended to enjoy it, although he had heard it hundreds of
times.

âItâs a mighty purty tale,â he said. âItâs so purty dat you dunner
whedder ter bâlieve it er not. Yit I speck itâs so, kaze one time in
forty-levâm hundred matters will turn out right eenâ upperds. Now, de
creeturs never had no godmâers; dey des hatter scuffle anâ scramble anâ
git âlong de besâ way dey kin.â

âBut they were very cruel,â remarked the little boy, âand they told
stories.â

âWhen it come ter dat,â Uncle Remus replied, âde creeturs ainât much
ahead er folks, anâ yit folks is got preachers fer ter tell um when
deyer gwine wrong. Moâ dan dat, dey got de Bible; anâ yit when you git
a little older, youâll wake up some fine day anâ say ter yoâseâf dat de
creeturs is got de âvantage er folks, spite er de fack dat dey ainât know
de diffunce âtwixâ right anâ wrong. Dey got ter live âcordinâ ter der
naturâ, kaze dey ainât know no better. I had in minâ a tale âbout Brer
Rabbit anâ de chickens, but I speck itâd hurt youâ feelinâs.â

The little boy said nothing for some time; he was evidently expecting
Uncle Remus to go ahead with his story. But he was mistaken about this,
for when the old man broke the silence, it was to speak of something
trivial or commonplace. The child, in spite of the training to which he
had been subjected, retained his boyâs nature. âUncle Remus,â he said,
âwhat about Brother Rabbit and the chickens?â

âWhich Brer Rabbit wuz dat, honey?â he asked with apparent surprise.

âYou said something about Brother Rabbit and the chickens.â

âWho? Me? I mought er said sumpân âbout um day âfoâ yistiddy, but it done
gone off ân my minâ. I done got so olâ dat my minâ flutters like a bird
in de bush.â

âWhy, you said that there was a tale about Brother Rabbit and the
chickens, but if you told it, my feelings would be hurt. You must think I
am a girl.â

Uncle Remus laughed. âNot ez bad ez dat, honey; but Iâm fearâd youer
monstous tetchous. Iâll tell you de tale, anâ den you kin tell it ter yoâ
pa, kaze itâs one he ainât never hear tell âbout.

âWell, den, one time, âway back yander dey wuz a man what live neighbor
ter de creeturs. Dey waânât nothinâ quare âbout dis Mr. Man; he wuz des a
plain, eveâyday kinder man, anâ he try ter git âlong de best he kin. He
ainât had no easy time, needer, kaze âtwant den like âtis now, when you
kin take yoâ cotton er yoâ corn ter town anâ have de money planked down
fer you.

âIn dem times dey waânât no town, anâ not much money. What folks dey wuz
hatter git âlong by swappinâ anâ traffickinâ. How dey done it, Iâll never
tell you, but do it dey did, anâ it seem like dey wuz in about ez happy
ez folks is deze days.

âWell, dish yer Mr. Man what Iâm a-tellinâ you âbout, he had a truck
patch, anâ a roasâinâ-year patch, anâ a goober patch. He growâd wheat anâ
barley, anâ likewise rye, anâ kiss de gals anâ make um cry. Anâ on top er
dat, he had a whole yard full er chickens, anâ darâs whar de trouble come
in. In dem times, all er de creeturs wuz meat-eaters, anâ twuz in about
ez much ez dey kin do, anâ sometimes a little moâ, fer ter git âlong
so dey wonât go ter bed hongry. Dey got in de habit er beinâ hongry,
anâ dey ainât never git over it. Look at Brer Wolf--gaunt; look at Brer
Fox--gaunt! Dey ainât never been able fer ter make deyseâf fat.

âSo den, ez you see um now, dat de way dey wuz in dem days, anâ a little
moâ so. Mr. Man, he had chickens, des like I tell you. Hens ez plump ez
a paâtridge; pullets so slick deyâd make yoâ mouf water, anâ fryinâ-size
chickens dat look like dey want ter git right in de pan. Now, when datâs
de case, what you reckon gwineter happen? Brer Wolf want chicken, Brer
Fox want chicken, anâ Brer Rabbit want chicken. Anâ dey ainât got nothinâ
what dey kin swap fer um. In deze days deyâd be called poâ, but I take
notice dat poâ folks gits des ez hongry ez de rich uns--anâ hongrier,
when it comes ter dat; yes, Lord! lots hongrier.

âWell, de creeturs got mighty frienâly wid Mr. Man. Deyâd call on âim,
speshually on Sundays, anâ he ainât had no better sense dan ter cluck up
his chickens des ter show um what a nice passel he had. When dis happen,
Brer Wolf under-jaw would trimble, anâ Brer Fox would dribble at de mouf
same ez a baby what cuttinâ his toofies. Ez fer Brer Rabbit, heâd des
laugh, anâ nobody ainât know what he laughinâ at. It went on dis way twel
it look like naturâ canât stanâ it, anâ den, bimeby, one night when de
moon ainât shininâ, Brer Rabbit take a notion dat heâd call on Mr. Man;
but when he got ter de place, Mr. Man done gone ter bed. De lights wuz
all out, anâ de dog wuz quiled up unâ de house sounâ asleep.

âBrer Rabbit shake his head. He âlow, âSholy deyâs sumpân wrong, kaze
allers, when I come, Mr. Man call up his chickens whar I kin look at um.â
I dunner what de matter wid âim. Anâ I donât see no chickens, needer. I
bounâ you sumpân done happen, anâ nobody ainât tell me de news, kaze dey
know how sorry Iâd be. Ef I could git in de house, Iâd go in dar anâ see
ef everâthing is all right; but I canât git in.â

âHe walk all ârounâ, he did, but he ainât see nobody. He wuz so skeerâd
heâd wake um up dat he walk on his tippy-toes. He âlow, âEf Mr. Man
knowâd I wuz here, heâd come out anâ show me his chickens, anâ I des
might ez well look in anâ see ef deyer all right.â Wid dat he went ter de
chicken-house anâ peep in, but he canât see nothinâ. He went ter de door,
anâ founâ it onlocked. Brer Rabbit grin, he did, anâ âlow, âMr. Man mosâ
knowâd dat Iâd be âlong some time ter-day, anâ done gone anâ lefâ his
chicken-house open so I kin see his pullets--anâ he knowâd dat ef I canât
see um, Iâd wanter feel um fer ter see how slick anâ purty dey is.â

[Illustration: â_Went off home des ez gayly ez a colt in a barley

âBrer Rabbit slap hisseâf on de leg anâ laugh fit ter kill. He ainât
make fuss nuff fer ter wake Mr. Man, but he woke de fat hens anâ de slick
pullets, anâ dey ax one anâer what de name er goodness is de matter. Brer
Rabbit laugh anâ say ter hisseâf dat ef heâd âaâ brung a bag, itâd make
a good overcoat fer four er five er de fat hens, anâ six er sevâm er de
slick pullets. Den he âlow, âWhy, what is I thinkinâ âbout? I got a bag
in my hanâ, anâ I fergit dat I had it. Itâs mighty lucky fer de chickens
dat I fotch it, kaze a little moâ--anâ deyâd âaâ been friz stiff!â So he
scoop in de bag ez many ez he kin tote. He âlow, âIâll take um home anâ
kinder git um warm, anâ ter-morrer Mr. Man kin have um back--ef he want
um.â anâ wid dat he mighty nigh choke hisseâf tryinâ fer ter keep fum
laughinâ. De chickens kinder flutter, but dey ainât make much fuss, anâ
Brer Rabbit flung de sack âcross his shoulders anâ went off home des ez
gayly ez a colt in a barley patch.â

âWouldnât you call that stealing, Uncle Remus?â inquired the little boy
very seriously.

âEf Brer Rabbit had âaâ been folks, itâd be called stealinâ, but you
know mighty well dat de creeturs dunno de diffunce âtwixâ takinâ anâ
stealinâ. When it come ter dat, deyâs a-plenty folks dat ainât know de
diffunce, anâ how you gwineter blame de creeturs?â Uncle Remus paused to
see what comment the little boy would make, but he was silent, though it
is doubtful if he was satisfied.

âBrer Rabbit tuck de chickens on home, he did, anâ made way wid um. Now,
dat wuz de lasâ er de chickens, but des de beginninâs er de feathers. Olâ
Miss Rabbit, she wanter burn um in de fier, but Brer Rabbit say de whole
neighborhood would smell um, anâ he âlow dat he got a better way dan dat.
So, nexâ morninâ atter brekkus, he borried a bag fum olâ Brer Wolf, anâ
inter dis he stuff de feathers, anâ start off down de road.

âWell, suh, ez luck would have it, Brer Rabbit hatter pass by Brer Fox
house, anâ who should be stanninâ at de gate wid his walkinâ-cane in
hanâ, but Brer Fox? Brer Fox, he fetched a bow, wid, âBrer Rabbit, whar
you gwine?â Brer Rabbit âlow, âEf I had de winâ, Brer Fox, Iâd be gwine
to mill. Dish yerâs a turrible load I got, anâ I dunner how soon Iâll giâ
out. I ainât strong in de back anâ limber in de knees like I useter be,
Brer Fox. You may be holdinâ yoâ own, anâ I hope you is, but Iâm on de
down grade, dey ainât no two ways âbout dat.â Wid dat, he sot de bag down
by de side er de road, anâ wipe his face wid his hankcher.

[Illustration: ââ_Brer Rabbit, whar you gwine?_ââ]

âBrer Fox, he come on whar Brer Rabbit wuz a-settinâ at, anâ ax ef itâs
corn er wheat. Brer Rabbit âlow dat tainât naâer one; itâs des some
stuff dat he gwine ter sell ter de miller. Brer Fox, he want ter know
what âtis so bad he ainât know what ter do, anâ he up anâ ax Brer Rabbit
pâintedly. Brer Rabbit say he fearâd ter tell âim kaze de truck what he
got in de bag is de onliest way he kin make big money. Brer Fox vow he
wonât tell nobody, anâ den Brer Rabbit say dat beinâ ez him anâ Brer Fox
is sech good frienâs--neighbors, ez you might say--he donât minâ tellinâ
âim, kaze he know dat atter Brer Fox done prommus, he wonât breave a word
âbout it. Den he say dat de truck what he got in de bag is roots er de
Winniannimus grass, anâ when deyer grounâ up at de mill, dey er wuff nine
dollars a pounâ.

âDis make Brer Fox open his eyes. He felt de heft er de bag, he did, anâ
he say dat itâs mighty light, anâ he dunner what make Brer Rabbit pant
anâ grunt when âtainât no heftier dan what it is.

âBrer Rabbit âlow dat de bag wouldnât âaâ felt heavy ter him ef he wuz
big anâ strong like Brer Fox. Dat kinder talk make Brer Fox feel biggity,
anâ he âlow dat heâll tote de bag ter mill ef Brer Rabbit feel like itâs
too heavy. Brer Rabbit say heâll be mighty much erbleeged, anâ be glad
fer ter pay Brer Fox sumpân ter boot. Anâ so, off dey put down de road,
Brer Fox a-trottinâ anâ Brer Rabbit gwine in a canter.

âBrer Fox ax what dey does wid de Winniannimus grass atter dey gits it
grounâ up at de mill. Brer Rabbit âlow dat rich folks buys it fer ter
make Whipmewhopme puddinâ. Brer Fox say heâll take some home when de
miller git it grounâ anâ see how it tasâes, anâ Brer Rabbit say heâs moâ
dan welcome. Atter dey been gwine on some little time, Brer Rabbit look
back anâ see Mr. Man a-cominâ, anâ he say ter Brer Fox, sezee, âBrer Fox,
you is de outdoinist man I ever is see. You done got me plumâ woâ out,

Rabbit! you ainât âquainted wid me; you dunner nothinâ âtall âbout me. I
kin go on dis a-way all day long anâ half de night.â Brer Rabbit roll his
big eyes, anâ say, âWell, suh!â

âAnâ den he sot down by de side er de road, anâ âtwuz all he kin do fer
ter keep fum bustinâ out in a big laugh.

âBimeby, Mr. Man come âlong anâ say, âWho dat wid de big bag on his
back?â Brer Rabbit make answer dat itâs Brer Fox. Mr. Man say, âWhat he
got in his bag?â Brer Rabbit âlow, âI ax âim, anâ he say itâs some kinder
grass what he takinâ ter de mill fer ter git grounâ, but I seed moâ dan
one chicken feather stickinâ ter de bag.â Mr. Man say, âDen heâs de chap
what tuck anâ tuck my fat hens anâ my slick pullets, anâ Iâll make âim
sorry dat he yever is see a chicken.â

âWid dat he put out atter Brer Fox, anâ Brer Rabbit, he put out too,
but he stay in de bushes, so dat nobody canât see âim. Mr. Man he cotch
up wid Brer Fox, anâ ax âim what he got in de bag. Brer Fox say he got
Winniannimus grass what he gwineter have grounâ at de mill. Mr. Man say
he wanter see what Winniannimus grass look like. Brer Fox sot de bag
down anâ say dat when itâs grounâ up de rich folks buys it fer ter make
Whipmewhopme puddinâ. Mr. Man open de bag, anâ dey waânât nothinâ in it

whop you,â anâ wid dat he grab Brer Fox in de collar, anâ mighty nigh
frailed de life outân âim.

âBrer Rabbit seed it well done, anâ he des fell down in de bushes anâ
roll anâ laugh twel he canât laugh no moâ.â

âWell, I donât see why he should think it was funny,â the little boy
remarked.

Uncle Remus looked hard at this modern little boy before he answered:
âMaybe you dunno Brer Fox, honey; I donât speck you hear talk er de way
he try ter git de inturn on Brer Rabbit. But on top er dat, Brer Rabbit
wuz so ticklish dat mosâ anything would make âim laugh. It sholy wuz
scanâlous de way Brer Rabbit kin laugh.â

LITTLE MISTER CRICKET AND THE OTHER CREATURES


Uncle Remus was very anxious to know what the child thought about
the story of Brother Rabbit and the chicken feathers, but he made no
inquiries; he was willing to let the youngsterâs preferences show
themselves without any urging on his part.

When the little boy did speak, he made no reference to Brother Rabbit
and the chicken feathers: his thoughts were elsewhere. âUncle Remus,â he
said, âI never saw a cricket. What do they look like?â

âYou ainât never see no cricket!â exclaimed Uncle Remus, with a
great display of amazement. âWell, dat bangs my time! What yoâ ma anâ
pa--speshually yoâ pa--what dey been doinâ all deze lonesome years dat
they ainât never showâd you no cricket? How dey speck you ter git âlong
in de worlâ ef dey ainât gwine ter tell you âbout de things you oughter
know, anâ show you de things dat you oughter see? You ainât never see no
cricket, anâ here you is mosâ ready ter shave off de down on your face!â

The child blushed. âWhy, I have no down on my face, Uncle Remus,â he
protested.

âWell, you will have some er deze days, anâ den what will folks think uv
a great big man what ainât never seed no cricket?â

âMother has never seen one,â replied the little boy, somewhat
triumphantly.

âSheâs a lady,â Uncle Remus explained, âanâ datâs diffunt. She been
brung up in âLantamatantarum, anâ I speck sheâd fall down anâ faint ef
she wuz ter see one. Folks ainât like dey use ter be; in my day anâ time,
ef man er boy wuz ter say dat he ainât never seed no cricket, dem what he
tolâ de news ter would git up anâ go âway fum âim; but deze days I bounâ
you deyâd huddle up close ârounâ âim, anâ jâine in wid âim, anâ say dey
ainât never is seed one nudder.â

âIf you had never seen one, you wouldnât talk that way, Uncle Remus,â
remarked the little boy quite seriously. âHow can I help myself, if I
have never seen one? It isnât my fault, is it?â

âTooby shoâ it ainât, honey. Nobody ainât blaminâ you. Yit when I see a
great big boy what ainât never seed no cricket, I bleeze ter ax myseâf
whar he come fum anâ what he been doinâ. I bounâ ef youâd âaâ been wid
yoâ granâmammy an me youâd âaâ seed crickets twel you got tired er seeinâ
um. Datâs de kinder folks we-all is. âTainât no trouble ter we-all ter
show chillun what dey oughter see. I bet you, youâ pa knowâd what a
cricket wuz long âfoâ he wuz olâ ez you is. Dey waânât nothinâ fer ter
hender âim. Miss Sally des turned âim over ter me, anâ say, âDonât let
âim git hurted,â anâ dar he wuz. Ef he ainât seed all dey wuz ter be
seed, it âuz kaze it âuz in a show, anâ de show in town whar he canât git
at it. Datâs de way we done wid him, anâ datâs de way Iâd like ter do wid
you. Itâs a mighty pity you waânât brung up here at home, stidder up dar
in âLantamatantarum, whar dey ainât nothinâ âtall but dust, anâ mud, anâ
money. De folks up dar ainât want de mud anâ dust, anâ de moâ dey wash
it off de moâ dey gits on um; but dey does want de money, anâ de moâ dey
scuffles fer it, de moâ dey has ter scuffle.â

âIs a cricket like a grasshopper, Uncle Remus?â inquired the little boy,
who took no interest in the old manâs prejudice against Atlanta.

âDey mosâly is, anâ den agâin dey mosâly ainât. Befoâ de time dat
olâ Grandaddy Cricket kick down de chimbley, dey waânât no moâ like
grasshoppers dan Iâm like a steer, but atter dat, when he git his knees
on wrongsudouterds, dey sorter look like grasshoppers âcepinâ when you
look at um right close, anâ den dey donât look like um.

âDey got lots moâ sense dan de yuther crawlinâ anâ hoppinâ creeturs. Dey
ought not ter be put wid de hoppinâ creeturs, kaze dey donât bâlong wid
âum, anâ dey wouldnât be a-hoppinâ in deze days ef olâ Grandaddy Cricket
hadnât âaâ got crippleâ when he kick de chimbley down. In de times when
olâ Boss Elephant, anâ Brer Lion, anâ Brer Tiger wuz meanderinâ rounâ in
deze parts, little Mr. Cricket wuz on mighty good terms wid um. Ez dey
say er folks, he stood mighty well whar dey knowâd âim--mighty well--anâ
he wuz âbout de sharpesâ er de whole caboodle, ef youâll leave out de
name er Brer Rabbit.

âIt come âbout one time dat de creeturs wuz all sunninâ deyseâf--it
mought er been Sunday fer all I know--anâ dey des stretch out anâ sot anâ
sot rounâ lickinâ der chops, anâ blinkinâ der eyes, anâ combinâ der haâr.
Mr. Elephant wuz swinginâ hisseâf backerds anâ forerds, anâ flinginâ de
sanâ on his back fer ter keep off de flies, anâ all de resâ wuz gwine on
âcordinâ ter der breed anâ need.

âEf youâll watch right close, honey, youâll finâ out fer yoâseâf
dat when folks ainât got much ter do, anâ little er nothinâ fer ter
talk âbout, deyâll soon git ter bragginâ, anâ datâs des de way wid de
creeturs. Brer Fox start it up; he say, âGents, âfoâ I fergit it off
ân my minâ, I wanter tell you dat Iâm de swiffesâ one in dis bunch.â
Mr. Elephant wink one er his little eyeballs, anâ fling his snout in de
aâr anâ whispered--anâ you mought âaâ hearn dat whisper a mile--âIâm de
strenkiest; I wanter call yoâ âtention ter dat.â Mr. Lion shuck his mane
anâ showed his tushes. He say, âDonât fergit dat Iâm de King er all de
creetur tribe.â Mr. Tiger stretched hisseâf anâ gapâd. He say, âIâm de
purtiest anâ de mosâ servigrous.â

âFum one ter de yuther de bragginâ went rounâ. Ef âtwant dis it uz dat,
anâ ef âtwant dat, âtwuz de yuther. Dey went on so twel bimeby little Mr.
Cricket chirped up anâ say he kin make all un um run dey heads off, fum
olâ Mr. Elephant down ter de lasâ one. Dey all laugh like itâs a good
joke, anâ Brer Fox he âlow dat he had de idee dat dey wuz all doinâ some
monstus tall bragginâ, but Mr. Cricket wuz away ahead er de whole gang,
anâ den he say, âHow you gwineter begin fer ter commence fer ter do all
deze great deeds anâ didoes?â Mr. Cricket say, âDes giâ me time; giâ me
time, anâ yoâll all hear fum me--yoâll hear, but you wonât stop fer ter
lisânâ, anâ den he work his jaws fer all de worlâ like Brer Rabbit does
when heâs chawinâ terbacker.

[Illustration: â_Brer Fox, say, âGents, â¦ I wanter tell you dat Iâm de
swiffesâ one in dis bunch_ââ]

âNow, olâ Brer Rabbit knowâd dat Mr. Cricket wuz up ter some sharp trick
er nâer, anâ so he wait twel he kin have a confab wid âim. He ainât had
long ter wait, kaze Mr. Crickley Cricket make up his minâ dat Brer Rabbit
wuz de one what kin heâp him out. Dey bofe wanter see one anâer, anâ
when datâs de case, dey ainât much trouble âbout it. Dey soon got off by
deyseâf, anâ Brer Rabbit âlow dat Mr. Cricket got a mighty big job on his
hanâs, anâ Mr. Cricket, he say itâs sech a big job dat he canât git thoo
wid it lessân Brer Rabbit will heâp âim out. Mr. Cricket say âtainât much
he gwine ter ax er Brer Rabbit, but little ez âtis, he bleeze ter ax it.
Brer Rabbit look at âim right hard anâ twisâ his mustache. âOut wid it,
Mr. Cricket; out wid it, anâ Iâll see ef I kin heâp you out. But I want
you ter take notice dat all de yuthers is got a crow fer ter pick wid me,
on account er de way I been doinâ.â

Mr. Cricket chirp up, âSo I hear, Brer Rabbit--so I hear,â anâ den he
went on fer ter tell Brer Rabbit what he want âim ter do. Brer Rabbit
laugh, he did, anâ say, âEf datâs all you want, Mr. Cricket, you kin
count me in, kaze I laid off fer ter heâp you lotâs moâ dan dat--lots
moâ.â Mr. Cricket say datâll be de greatesâ plenty, anâ wid dat dey went
off home fer ter kinder resâ deyseâf, but not âfoâ dey fix on a day when
deyâll have time fer ter work der trick on de yuther creeturs.

âDey âgreed on de day, anâ dat day dey met, anâ atter colloguinâ
tergedder, off dey put ter de place whar dey âspected ter finâ de yuther
creeturs. De fust one dey meet wuz olâ Mr. Elephant. Dey pass de time er
day, dey did, anâ Brer Rabbit say he got bad news. Mr. Elephant flung up
his snout like he âstonishâd, anâ swung backerd anâ forerds like he âbout
ter cry. Brer Rabbit âlow dat de winâ blowâd a hickây-nut down right âpon
top er Mr. Cricket anâ cripple âim so he canât go home, anâ he ax ef Mr.
Elephant wonât tote âim ez fur ez he kin. Mr. Elephant say tooby shoâ he
will anâ be glad in de bargain, anâ so he kneel down, he did, anâ let Mr.
Cricket crawl on his back.

âBut Mr. Cricket crawl furder dan de back; he crawl on Mr. Elephant
neck, anâ den inter his yâear. Dis whar he wanter git, anâ soon ez he got
settle, he flutter his wings right fasâ anâ Mr. Elephant think de winâ
is blowinâ thoo de trees. Mr. Cricket flutter his wings harder, anâ Mr.
Elephant think deyâs a storm corninâ up. He splunge thoo de bushes, he
did, anâ ef Mr. Cricket hadnât âaâ been inside his year, heâd âaâ been
knocked off by de limâs er de trees. Ez âtwuz, he sot back anâ laugh, anâ
say ter hisseâf dat Mr. Elephant ainât hear nothinâ âtall ter what he
will hear.

âWid dat, he chune up his whistle, anâ started fer ter blow on it. He
blowâd kinder low ter begin wid, anâ den he âgun ter git louder. Anâ de
louder he got de moâ he skeerâd Mr. Elephant, anâ he went splunginâ thoo
de woods same ez a harrycane. He went so fasâ dat he come mighty nigh
runninâ over King Lion whiles he wuz talkinâ ter olâ Brer Tiger. He ainât
hear âum say, âMr. Elephant, whar you gwine?â but he stop right whar dey
wuz anâ âgun ter turn rounâ anâ rounâ. King Lion ax âim what de matter,
anâ Mr. Elephant say he bâlieve he gwine ravinâ âstracted. He âlow, âI
got a singinâ anâ a whistlinâ in one er my years, anâ I dunner which un

âDey lisân, dey did, anâ bless gracious, dey kin hear it. Olâ King

Elephant, like you des âbout ter bile over, anâ ef datâs what yer gwine

âMr. Elephant turn rounâ anâ rounâ, he did, anâ ef heâd âaâ been
light-headed like some folks I knows, heâd âaâ drapt right dar. Mr.
Cricket watch his chance, anâ when Mr. Elephant got nigh ter King Lion,
he tuck a flyinâ jump anâ lit right in King Lionâs mane, anâ âtwant long
âfoâ he made his way ter de year. But while he wuz makinâ his way dar Mr.
Elephant stopped whirlinâ rounâ; he stop anâ lisân, he did, anâ he ainât

âBy dis time, Mr. Cricket had got in King Lion year, anâ âtwant long

VI

WHEN BROTHER RABBIT WAS KING


One afternoon, while Uncle Remus was sitting in the sun, he felt so
comfortable and thankful for all the blessings that he enjoyed, and
for those that he had seen others enjoy, that he suddenly closed his
eyes; and he had no sooner done so than he drifted across the dim and
pleasant borderland that lies somewhere between sleeping and waking.
He must have drifted back again immediately, for it seemed that he was
not so fast asleep that he was unable to hear the sound of stealthy
footsteps somewhere near him. Instantly he was on the alert, but still
kept his eyes closed. He knew at once that the little boy was trying to
surprise him. The lad had improved much in health since coming to the
plantation, and with the growth of his strength had come a certain degree
of boisterousness that his mother thought was somewhat unusual, but which
his grandmother and Uncle Remus knew was the natural result of good
health.

By opening one eye a trifle, Uncle Remus could watch the youngster,
who was creeping, Indian-like, upon him, and this gave the old negro
an immense advantage, for just as the little boy was about to jump
at him, Uncle Remus straightened himself in his chair and uttered a
blood-curdling yell that would have alarmed a much larger and older
person than the lad. As a matter of fact, the little fellow was almost
paralyzed with fright, and for a moment or two could hardly get his
breath.

âWhy, what in the world is the matter with you, Uncle Remus?â he asked as
soon as he could speak.

âWuz dat you cominâ âlong dar, honey?â said Uncle Remus, by way of
response. âWell, ef âtwuz, you kin des go up dar ter de big house anâ
tell um all dat you saved my life, kaze dat what you done. Dey ainât
no tellinâ what would âaâ happen ef you hadnât âaâ come creepinâ âlong
anâ woke me up, kaze whiles I wuz dozinâ dar I wuz on a train, anâ
de bullgine look like it wuz runninâ away. âTwant one er deze yer
âcommydatinâ trains, kaze de man what tuck up de tickets say he waânât
in no hurry fer ter see how fur anybody gwine; dey wuz all bounâ fer de
same place, anâ when dey got dar deyâd know it. De kyars wuz lined wid
caliker, anâ de brakeman wuz made outân straw. It went on, it did, anâ
de bullgine run faster anâ faster twel it run so fast you couldnât hear
it toot fer brakes, anâ des âbout de time dat eveâything wuz a gittinâ
smashed up, here you come anâ wokened me--anâ a mighty good thing, kaze
ef Iâd âaâ stayed on dat train dey wouldnât âaâ been ânough er me left
fer de congergation ter sing a song over. Iâm mighty thankful dat deyâs
somebody got sense ânough fer ter come âlong anâ skeer me out er my
troubles.â

This statement was intended to change the course of the little boyâs
thoughts--to cause him to forget that he had been frightened--and it was
quite successful, for he began to talk about dreams in general, telling
some peculiar ones of his own, such as children have.

âTalkinâ âbout dreams,â remarked Uncle Remus, âit put me in minâ er de
man what been sick off anâ on, anâ he hatter be mighty keerful er his
eatinâ. One night he had a dream. It seemed like dat somebody come âlong
anâ giâ him a great big hunk er olâ time ginger-cake, anâ it smell so
sweet anâ taste so good dat he eât âbout a pounâ. He wuz eatinâ it in his
sleep, but de dream wuz so natchal dat de nexâ morninâ dey hatter senâ
fer de doctor, anâ âtwuz eâen âbout all dey could do fer ter pull âim
thoo. De doctor gun âim all de truck what he had in his saddle-bags, anâ
âlow dat he bâlieve in his soul heâd hatter senâ fer moâ, anâ den atter
dat he tuck anâ lay down de law ter de man. He say dat whatsomever else
he mought do, he better not eat no ginger-cakes in his dreams, kaze de
next un âud be shoâ fer ter take âim off spite er all de doctor truck in
de rounâ worlâ.â

Then the little boy told of a dream he had had. It seems that he had
slipped into the pantry, when no one was looking, and had taken a piece
of apple-pie. It wasnât stealing, he said, for he knew that if he asked
his grandmother for a piece she would have given it to him; but he didnât
want to bother her while she was talking to the sewing-woman, and so he
just went in the pantry and got it for himself. Perhaps he took a larger
piece than his grandmother would have given him, but he had nothing to
measure it by, and so he was compelled to guess how much she would have
given him.

âI bounâ you stretched yoâ guesser, honey,â said Uncle Remus dryly.

The child admitted with a laugh that perhaps he had, and he was very
sorry of it afterwards, for when he went to bed he dreamed that something
scratched at his door and made such a fuss that he was obliged to get up
and let it in. He didnât wait to see what it was, but just flung the door
open, and ran and jumped back in bed, pulling the cover over his head. In
the dream he lay right still and listened. Everything was so quiet that
he became curious, and finally ventured to look out from under the cover.
Well, sir, the sight that he saw was enough, for between the door and the
bed a big black dog was lying. He seemed to be very tired, for his tongue
hung out long and red, and he was panting as though he had come a long
way in a very short time.

Uncle Remus groaned in sympathy. The black dog that gallops through a
dream with his tongue hanging out was one of his familiars. âI know dat
dog,â he said. âHe got a bunch er white on de eenâ er his tail, anâ his
eyeballs look like dey green in de dark. You call him anâ heâll growl,
call him agâin, anâ heâll howl. Iâd know dat dog ef I wuz ter see him
in de daytime--Iâd know him so well dat Iâd run anâ ax somebody fer ter
please, suh, wake me up, anâ do it mighty quick.â

The little boy didnât know anything about that; what he did know was
that the dog in his dream, when he had rested himself, jumped up on the
bed, and began to nose at the cover, and he seemed to get mad when he
failed to pull it off the little boy. He tried and tried, and then he
seized a corner of the counterpane, or the spread, or whatever you call
it, and shook it with his teeth. When he grew tired of this, the little
boy could hear him smelling all about over the bed, and then he knew the
creature was hunting for the piece of apple-pie.

Uncle Remus agreed with the child about this. ââCordinâ ter my notion,â
he said, âwhen folks slip ârounâ anâ take dat what donât bâlong ter um er
dat what dey oughtnât ter have by good rights, de big black dog is shoâ
ter come ârounâ growlinâ anâ smellinâ atter dey goes ter bed. Dey ainât
no two ways âbout dat. Dey may not know it, dey may be too sleepy fer ter
see âim in der dreams, but de dogâs dar. Moâ dan dat, dogs will growl anâ
smell ârounâ ef deyer in dreams er outer dreams. Dey got in de habits
er smellinâ âway back yander in de days when olâ Brer Rabbit had tooken
de place er de King one time when de King wanter go off down de country
fishinâ.â

The little boy seemed to be very much interested in this information,
but while they were speaking of this curious habit that is common to
dogs, a hound that had been raised on the place came into view. He was
going at a gallop, as if he had important business to attend to, but when
he had galloped past a large tree, he paused suddenly, and turned back to
investigate it with his nose; and though he was entirely familiar with
the tree, it seemed to be new to him now, for he smelled all around the
trunk of it and was apparently much perplexed. Whatever information he
received was sufficient to cause him to forget all about the business
that had caused him to come galloping past the tree, for when his
investigation had ended, he turned about and went back the way he had
come.

âNow, you see dat, donât you?â exclaimed Uncle Remus, with some show of
indignation. âAinât it des a little moâ dan you wanter stanâ? Here he
come, gwine, I dunner whar, des a-gallinâ-up like he done been sent fer.
He come ter dat ar tree, he did, anâ went on by--spang by!--anâ den âfoâ
you kin bat yoâ eyeball, whiff, he turn rounâ anâ go ter smellinâ at de
tree, des like he ainât never seed it befoâ; anâ he must âaâ got some
kind er news whar he smellinâ at, kaze atter he smell twel it look like
he gwineter smell de bark clean off, he fergit all âbout whar he gwine,
anâ tuck his tail anâ go on back whar he come fum. Maybe you know sumpân
âbout it, honey--you anâ de balance er de white folks, but me--Iâm bofe
blinâ anâ deff when it come ter tellinâ you what de dog founâ out. I may
know what make âim smell at de tree, but what news he got I never is ter
tell you.â

âWell, you know you said that dogs got in the habit of smelling away back
yonder when old Brother Rabbit took the place of the King, who had gone
fishing. I was wondering if that was a story.â

âWuz you, honey?â Uncle Remus asked with a pleased smile. âWell, you
shoâ is got a dumplinâ eye fer de kinder tales what I tells. I bâlieve
ef I wuz ter take one er dem olâ-time tales anâ skin it anâ drag de hide
thoo de house anâ rounâ de lot--ef I wuz ter do dat, I bâlieve youâd open
up on de trail same ez olâ Louder follerinâ on atter Brer Possum; I shoâ
does!â

[Illustration: â_Some run fer ter dig bait_â]

The child seemed to appreciate the compliment, and he laughed in a way
that did the old negro a world of good. âI have found out one thing,â
said the little boy with emphasis. âWhenever you are hinting at a story,
you always look at me out of the corner of your eye, and thereâs always a
funny little wrinkle at the corner of your mouth.â

âWell, suh!â exclaimed Uncle Remus, gleefully; âwell, suh! anâ me
a-settinâ right here anâ doinâ dat a-way âfoâ yoâ face anâ eyes! I
never would âaâ âspeckted it. Peepinâ out de cornder er my eyeball, anâ
a-wrinklinâ at de mouf! It look like I musâ be gettinâ olâ anâ fibble in
de minâ.â He chuckled as proudly as if some one had given him a piece of
pound-cake of which he was very fond. But presently his chuckling ceased,
and he leaned back in his chair with a serious air.

âI dunno so mighty well âbout all de yuther times you talkinâ âbout,
honey, but when I say what I did âbout olâ Brer Rabbit takinâ de place
er der King, I shoâ had a tale in my minâ. I say tale, but I dunner what
youâll say âbout it; you kin name it atter you git it. Well, way back
yander, mosâ âfoâ de time when folks got in de habits er dreaminâ dreams,
dey wuz a King anâ dish yer King kingâd it over all un um what wuz dar,
moâ speshually de creeturs, kaze what folks dey wuz ainât know nothinâ
âtall âbout whedder dey need any kinginâ er not; look like dey didnât
count.

âWell, dish yer King what Iâm a-tellinâ you âbout had purty well growâd
up at de business, and de time come when he got mighty tired er settinâ
in one place anâ holâinâ a crown on his head fer ter keep it fum fallinâ
on de floâ. He say ter hisseâf dat he wanter git out anâ git de fresh
aâr, anâ have some fun âlong wid dem what he been kinginâ over. He âlow
dat he wanter fix it so dat he ainât a-keerinâ whedder school keep er no,
anâ he ax um all what de best thing he kin do. Well, one say one thing
anâ de yuther say tâother, but bimeby some un um chipped in anâ say dat
de best way ter have fun is ter go fishinâ, anâ dis kinder hit de King
right in de middle er his notions.

âHe jump up anâ crack his heels tergedder, he did, anâ he say dat datâs
what he been thinkinâ âbout all de time. A-fishinâ it wuz anâ a-fishinâ
heâd go, ef his life wuz sparâd twel he kin git ter de creek. Anâ, wid
dat, dey wuz a mighty stirrinâ rounâ âmongsâ dem what he wuz a-kinginâ
over; some un um run off ter git fishinâ-poles, anâ some run fer ter dig
bait, anâ some run fer ter git de bottle, anâ dar dey had it--youâd âaâ
thunk dat all creation wuz gwine fishinâ.â

âUncle Remus,â said the little boy, interrupting the old man, âwhat did
they want with a bottle?â

The old man looked at the child with a puzzled expression on his face.
âDe bottle?â he asked with a sigh. âI bâlieve I did say sumpân âbout de
bottle. I dunner whedder it âuz a long white bottle er a chunky black un.
Dem what handed de tale down ter me ainât say what kinder one it wuz, anâ
Iâm fearâd ter say right short off dat it âuz one er de yuther. Weâll des
call it a plain, eveâyday bottle anâ let it go at dat.â

âBut what did they want with a bottle, Uncle Remus?â persisted the little
boy.

âYou ainât never been fishinâ, is you honey? Anâ you ainât never see
yoâ daddy go fishinâ. All I know is dat whar deyâs any fishinâ gwine on,
youâll finâ a bottle someârs in de neighborhoods ef youâll scratch about
in de bushes. Well, de creeturs done like folks long âfoâ folks got ter
doinâ dat a-way, anâ when dish yer King went a-fishinâ, he had ter have a
bottle fer ter put de bait in.

âWhen eveâything got good anâ ready, anâ de King wuz âbout ter start
off, olâ Brer Rabbit kinder hung his head on one side anâ set up a
snigger. De King, he look âstonish anâ den he âlow, âWhatâs de joke, olâ
frienâ?â âWell,â sez olâ Brer Rabbit, sezee, âit look like ter me dat
you âbout ter go off anâ fergit sumpân. âTainât none er my business,
but I couldnât heâp fum gigglinâ.â De King, he say, âUp anâ out wid it,
olâ frienâ; leâs hear de wust dey is ter hear.â Olâ Brer Rabbit, he
say, sezee, âI dunner ef it makes any diffunce, but who gwine ter do de
kinginâ whiles you gone a-fishinâ?â

[Illustration: â_De King â¦ sot right flat in a cheer_â]

âWell, de King look like he wuz mightâly tuck back; he flung up bofe
hanâs anâ sot right flat in a cheer, anâ den he âlow, âI done got so dat
Iâm de fergittinesâ creetur what live on top er de grounâ; you may hunt
high anâ low anâ you wonât never finâ dem what kin beat me a-fergittinâ.
Here I wuz âbout fer ter go off anâ leave de whole business at sixes anâ
sevâms.â Olâ Brer Rabbit, he say, sezee, âOh, I speck dat would âaâ been
all right; dey ainât likely ter be no harrycane, ner no freshâ whiles you

off on a frolic anâ leave eveâything fer ter look atter itseâf. What yoâ
reckon folks would âaâ said? I tell you now, dey ainât no fun in beinâ
a King, kaze yoâ time ainât yoâ own, anâ you canât turn rounâ widout
skinninâ yoâ shins on some by-law er ânother. âFoâ I go, ef go I does,
I got ter âpâint somebody fer ter take my place anâ be King whiles Iâm
gone; anâ ef âtwant dat, itâd be sumpânâ else, anâ so dar you go year in
anâ year out.â

[Illustration: â_Dey ainât no fun in beinâ a King_â]

âHe sot dar, he did, anâ study anâ study, anâ bimeby he say, sezee,
âBrer Rabbit, sâposinâ you take my place whiles Iâm gone? Iâll pay you
well; all you got to do is ter set right flat in a cheer anâ make a
dollar a day.â Olâ Brer Rabbit say dat would suit him mighty well, kaze
he bleeze fer ter have some money so he kin buy his olâ âoman a caliker
dress. Well, it ainât take um long fer ter fix it all up, anâ so Brer
Rabbit, he done de kinginâ whiles de King gone a-fishinâ. He made de job
a mighty easy one, kaze stidder settinâ up anâ holâinâ de crown on his

âWell, when de King went a-fishinâ, he went de back way, anâ he ainât

kaze it uz de same Mr. Dog what done give him many a long chase.

[Illustration: â_Well Mr. Dog come creepinâ in_â]

âWell, Mr. Dog, he stood dar wid his head hanginâ down anâ his tail
âtween his legs. Eveâything wuz so still anâ sollum dat he âgun ter git

widout runninâ over somebody. Dey ainât no way, anâ so Mr. Dog sorter
wiggle de eenâ er his tail fer ter show dat he ainât mad, anâ he stood
dar âspecktinâ dat eveây minnit would be de nexâ.

âBimeby, somebody say, âWho dat wanter see de King anâ what business is

now has ter lean up agâin de fence, anâ lean mighty hard, ef dey wanter
make a shadder. Mr. Dog had lots moâ ter say, but de long anâ de short un
it wuz dat him anâ his kinnery waânât treated right.

âOlâ Brer Rabbit, which he playinâ King fer de day, he kinder study,

HOW OLD CRANEY-CROW LOST HIS HEAD


One day, while Uncle Remus was preparing some wild cherry bark for
a decoction which he took for his rheumatism, the little boy, who
was an interested spectator of the proceedings, chanced to hear a
noise overhead. Looking up, he saw a very large bird flying over. He
immediately called the attention of Uncle Remus to the bird, which was
indeed a singular-looking creature. Its long neck stretched out in front,
and its long legs streamed out behind. Its wings were not very large,
and it had no tail to speak of, but it flew well and rapidly, apparently
anxious to reach its destination in the shortest possible time.

Uncle Remus shaded his eyes with his right hand as he gazed upward at
the bird. âLaws-a-mussy!â he exclaimed; âis dey anybody yever see de beat
er dat!â He knew well that the bird was a blue heron going to join its
kindred in Florida, but he affected great surprise at sight of the bird,
and continued to gaze at it as long as it remained in sight. He drew a
long breath when it could no longer be seen, and shook his head sadly.
âEf she ainât got no moâ sense dan what her great-grandaddy had, Iâm
mighty sorry fer her,â he declared.

âWhat kind of a bird is it, Uncle Remus?â the child inquired.

âFolks useter call um Craney-Crows, honey, but now dey ainât got no name
but des plain blue crane--anâ I dunner whedder dey er wuff sech a big
name. Yit I ainât got nothinâ agâin um dat I knows un. Moâ dan dat, when
I ermembers âbout de olâ grandaddy crane what drifted inter deze parts,
manyâs de long time ago, âtwouldnât take much fer ter make me feel right
sorry fer de whole kit anâ bilinâ un um--dey er sech start natchul fools.â

âBut what is there to be sorry about, Uncle Remus?â the little boy
asked. He was rapidly learning to ask questions at the proper time.

ââBout dey havinâ sech a little grain er sense, honey. Ef you knowâd what
I does, I dunner ef youâd be tickled, er ef youâd feel sorry, anâ itâs de
same way wid me. When I think er dat olâ Great-Grandaddy Crane, I dunner
whedder ter laugh er cry.â

This was small satisfaction to the little boy, and he was compelled to
inquire about it. As this was precisely what the old negro wanted him to
do, he lost nothing by being inquisitive. âDey wuz one time--I dunno de
day, anâ I dunno de year, but âtwuz one time--dey come a big storm. De
winâ blowâd a harrycane, anâ de rain rained like all de sky anâ de clouds
in it done been turn ter water. De winâ blowâd so hard dat it lifted olâ
Craney-Crow fum his roost in de lagoons way down yanâ whar dey live at,
anâ fotch âim up in deze parts, anâ when he come, he come a-whirlinâ. De
winâ tuck âim up, it did, anâ turn âim rounâ anâ rounâ, anâ when he lit
whar he did, he stagger des like he wuz drunk--you know how you feel when
you been turninâ rounâ anâ rounâ. Well, dat wuz de way wid him; he wuz so
drunk dat he hatter lean up agâin a tree.

âBut âtwant long âfoâ he âgun ter feel all right, anâ he look rounâ fer
ter see whar he at. He look anâ he look, but he ainât finâ out, kaze
he wuz a mighty fur ways fum home. Yit he feel de water half-way up
his legs, anâ ef olâ Craney-Crow is in a place whar he kin do a little
wadinâ, he kinder has de home-feelinâ--you know how dat is yoâseâf. Well,
dar he wuz, a mighty fur ways fum home, anâ yit up ter his knees in
water, anâ he des stood dar, he did, anâ tuck his ease, hopinâ fer better
times bimeby. Now, de place whar he wuz blowâd ter wuz Long Cane Swamp,
anâ I wish I had time fer ter take you over dar anâ show you right whar
he wuz at when he lit, anâ I wish I had time fer ter take you all thoo de
Swamp anâ let you see fer yoâseâf what kinder Thing it is. âTainât only
des a Swamp; itâs sumpân wuss ân dat. You kin stanâ in de middle un it,
anâ mosâ hear it ketch its breff, anâ dat what make I say dat âtainât no
Swamp, fer all it look like one.

âWell, dar wuz olâ Craney-Crow, anâ dar wuz de Thing you call de Swamp,
anâ bimeby de sun riz anâ let his lamp shine in dar in places; an denâ
olâ Craney-Crow had time fer ter look rounâ anâ see whar he wuz at. But
when he finâ out, he ainât know no moâ dan what he know at fusâ. Now, you
kin say what you please, anâ you kin laugh ef you wanter, but Iâm a-gwine
ter tell you dat de Swamp knowâd dat dey wuz somebody dar what ainât
bâlong dar. Ef you ax me how de Swamp knowâd, Iâll shake my head anâ
shet my eyes; anâ ef you ax me how I know it knowâd, Iâll des laugh at
you. Youâll hatter take my word er leave it, I donât keer which. But dar
âtwuz. De Swamp knowâd dat somebody wuz dar what ainât bâlong dar, anâ it
went ter sleep anâ had bad dreams, anâ it keep on havinâ dem dreams all
day long.â

The little boy had accepted Uncle Remusâs statements up to this point,
but when he said that the Swamp went to sleep and had bad dreams, the
child fairly gasped with doubtful astonishment. âWhy, Uncle Remus, how
could a swamp go to sleep?â

âItâs des like I tell you, honey; you kin take my word er you kin leave
it. One way er de yuther, you wonât be no better off dan what you is
right now. All I know is dis, dat you canât tell no tale ter dem what
donât bâlieve it.â

âDo you believe it, Uncle Remus? Mother says the stories are fables.â
Thus the little boy was imbued, without knowing it, with the modern
spirit of scientific doubt.

âDoes you speck Iâd tell you a tale dat I donât bâlieve? Why, I dunner
how Iâd put de words one atter de yuther. Whensomever you ainât bâlievinâ
what Iâm a-tellinâ, honey, des leâ me know, anâ I wonât take de time anâ
trouble fer ter tell it.â

âWell, tell me about the Swamp and old Craney-Crow,â said the little boy,
placing his small hand on Uncle Remusâs knee coaxingly.

âWell, suh, ef so be I must, den I shill. Whar wuz I? Yasser! de Swamp,
beinâ wide-awake all night long, is bleeze ter sleep endurinâ er de day,
anâ so, wid olâ Craney-Crow stanninâ in de water, when de sun rise up, de
Swamp know dat sumpân wuz wrong, anâ it went ter sleep anâ had mighty bad
dreams. De sun riz anâ riz; it come up on one side er de Swamp, anâ atter
so long a time stood over it anâ look down fer ter see what de matter.
But bright ez de lamp er de sun wuz, it canât light up de Swamp, anâ so
it went on over anâ went down on tâer side.

âDe day wuz in about like deze days is, anâ whiles de sun wuz sâarchinâ
rounâ tryinâ fer ter finâ out what de trouble is in de Swamp, olâ
Craney-Crow wuz wadinâ âbout in de water tryinâ ter finâ some frog steak
fer his dinner, er maybe a fish fer ter whet his appetite on. But dey
waânât nary frog ner nary fish, kaze de Swamp done gone ter sleep. De
moâ olâ Craney-Crow waded de moâ shallerer de water got, twel bimeby day
waânât nuff fer ter moâ dan wet his foots. He say, âHey! how come dis?â
But he ainât got no answer, kaze de Swamp, wid all its bad dreams, wuz
sounâ asleep. Dey wuz pools er water rounâ anâ about, anâ olâ Craney-Crow
went fum one ter de yuther, anâ fum yuther ter tâother, but âtainât do
him no good. He went anâ stood by um, he did, but whiles he stanninâ dar,
dey waânât a riffle on top un um. Bimeby he got tired er walkinâ about,
anâ he stood on one leg fer ter resâ hisseâf--dough ef anybodyâll tell me
how you gwineter resâ yoâseâf wid stanninâ on one leg, Iâll set up anâ
tell um tales fum now tell Chrisâmus, kaze ef I git tired I kin stanâ on
one leg anâ do my restinâ dat a-way.

âWell, den, dar wuz olâ Craney-Crow, anâ dar wuz de Swamp. Olâ
Craney-Crow wuz wide-awake, but de Swamp wuz fast asleep anâ dreaminâ
bad dreams like a wilâ hoss anâ waggin gwine down hill. But de Swamp
waânât no stiller dan olâ Craney-Crow, stanninâ on one leg wid one eye
lookinâ in de tops er de trees, anâ de yuther one lookinâ down in de
grass. But in de Swamp er outân de Swamp, time goes on anâ night draps
down, anâ datâs de way it done dis time. Anâ when night drapped down, de
Swamp kinder stretch itseâf anâ âgun ter wake up. Olâ Brer Mud Turkle
opened his eyes anâ sneeze so hard dat he roll off de bank inter de
water--kersplash--anâ he so close ter olâ Craney-Crow dat he fetched a
hop sideways, anâ come mighty nigh steppinâ on Mr. Billy Black Snake. Dis
skeerâd âim so dat he fetched anâer hop, anâ mighty nigh lit on de frog
what he been huntinâ fer. De frog he say âhey!â anâ dove in de mud-puddle.

âAtter dat, when olâ Craney-Crow move âbout, he lifâ his foots high,
anâ he done like de ladies does when dey walk in a wet place. De whole
caboodle wuz branâ new ter olâ Craney-Crow, anâ he look wid all his
eyes, anâ lissen wid all his years. Dey wuz sumpân nâer gwine on, but he
canât make out what âtwuz. He ainât never is been in no swamp befoâ, moâ
speshually a Swamp what got life in it. He been useter maâshy places,
whar dey ainât nothinâ but water anâ high grass, but dar whar he finâ
hisseâf atter de harrycane, dey waânât no big sight er water, anâ what
grass dey wuz, waânât longer ân yoâ finger. Stidder grass anâ water, dey
wuz vines, anâ reeds, anâ trees wid moss on um dat made um look like
Granâsuh Graybeard, anâ de vines anâ creepers look like dey wuz reachinâ
out fer âim.

âHe walked about, he did, like de grounâ wuz hot, anâ when he walk he
look like he wuz on stilts, his legs wuz so long. He hunt rounâ fer a
place fer ter sleep, anâ whiles he wuz doinâ dat he tuck notice dat
dey wuz sumpân nâer gwine on dat he ainât never is see de like un. De
jacky-ma-lantuns, dey lit up anâ went sailinâ rounâ des like dey wuz
huntinâ fer âim anâ de frogs, dey holler at âim wid, âWhat you doinâ
here? What you doinâ here?â Mr. Coon rack by anâ laugh at âim; Mr. Billy
Gray Fox peep outân de bushes anâ bark at âim; Mr. Mink show âim de green
eyes, anâ Mr. Whipperwill scolâ âim.

âHe move âbout, he did, anâ atter so long a time dey let âim âlone, anâ
den when dey waânât nobody ner nothinâ pesterinâ âim, he âgun ter look
rounâ fer hisseâf. Peepinâ fust in one bush anâ den in anâer, he tuck
notice dat all de birds what fly by day had done gone ter bed widout der
heads. Look whar he mought, olâ Craney-Crow ainât see naâer bird but what
had done tuck his head off âfoâ he went ter bed. Look close ez he kin, he
ainât see no bird wid a head on. Dis make âim wonder, anâ he ax hisseâf
how come dis, anâ de onliest answer what he kin think un is dat gwine
ter bed wid der heads on wuz done gone out er fashion in dat part er de
country.

âNow, you kin say what you please âbout de creeturs anâ der kinâ--âbout
de fowls dat fly, anâ de feathery creeturs what run on de grounâ--you
kin say what you please âbout um, but dey got pride; dey donât wanter be
outân de fashion. When it comes ter dat, deyer purty much like folks, anâ
dat âuz de way wid olâ Craney-Crow; he donât wanter be out er fashion. He
âshameâ fer ter go ter bed like he allers been doinâ, kaze he ainât want
de yuthers fer ter laugh anâ say he âuz fum de country deestrick, whar
dey dunno much. Yit, study ez he mought, he dunner which a-way ter do fer
ter git his head off. De yuthers had der heads unâ der wing. But he ainât
know dat.

âHe look rounâ, he did, fer ter see ef dey ainât some un he kin ax âbout
it, anâ he ainât hatter look long nudder, fer dar, settinâ right at âim,
wuz olâ Brer Pop-Eye.â

âBut, Uncle Remus, who was old Brother Pop-Eye?â inquired the little boy.

âNobody in all de rounâ worlâ, honey, but Brer Rabbit. He had one name
fer de uplanâ anâ anâer name fer de bottom lanâ--de swamps anâ de dreens.
Wharsomever dar wuz any mischieviousness gwine on, right dar wuz Brer
Rabbit ez big ez life anâ twice ez natchul. He wuz so close ter olâ
Craney-Crow dat he hatter jump when he seed âim. Brer Pop-Eye say: âNo
needs fer ter be skeerâd, frienâ Craney-Crow. You may be moâ dan sho dat
Iâm a well-wisher.â Olâ Craney-Crow âlow: âIt do me good fer ter hear
you sesso, Mr. Pop-Eye, anâ seeinâ dat itâs you anâ not some un else, I
donât minâ axinâ you how all de flyinâ birds takes der heads off when dey
go ter bed. It sho stumps me.â Brer Pop-Eye say, âAnâ no wonder, frienâ
Craney-Crow, kaze youer stranger in deze parts. Dey ainât nothinâ ter
hide âbout it. De skeeters is been so bad in dis Swamp sence de year one,
anâ endurinâ er de time whatâs gone by, dat dem what live here done got
in de habits er takinâ off der heads anâ puttinâ um in a safe place.â

âDe Craney-Crow âlow: âBut how in de name er goodness does dey do it,
Brer Pop-Eye?â Mr. Pop-Eye laugh ter hisseâf âway down in his gizzard.
He say: âDey donât do it by deyseâf, kaze dat âud be axinâ too much. Oh,
no! dey got some un hired fer ter do dat kinâ er work.â âAnâ whar kin I
finâ âim, Brer Pop-Eye?â sez olâ Craney-Crow, sezee. Brer Pop-Eye âlow:
âHeâll be rounâ terreckly; he allers hatter go rounâ fer ter see dat he
ainât miss none un um.â Olâ Craney-Crow sorter study, he did, anâ den he
âlow: âHow does dey git der heads back on, Brer Pop-Eye?â Brer Pop-Eye
shuck his head. He say: âIâd tell you ef I knowâd, but I hatter stay up
so much at night, dat âlong âbout de time when dey gits der heads put
on, Iâm sounâ asleep anâ snoâinâ right along. Ef you sesso, Iâll hunt
up de doctor what does de business, anâ I speck heâll commerdate you--I
kin prommus you dat much, sence you been so perlite.â Olâ Craney-Crow
laugh anâ say: âI done finâ out in my time dat dey donât nothinâ pay like
perliteness, speshually ef sheâs ginnywine.â

âWid dat, Brer Pop-Eye put out, he did, fer ter finâ Brer Wolf. Knowinâ
purty well whar he wuz, âtwant long âfoâ here dey come gallopinâ back.
Brer Pop-Eye say: âMr. Craney-Crow, dis is Mr. Dock Wolf; Mr. Dock Wolf,
dis is Mr. Craney-Crow; glad fer ter make you âquainted, gents.ââ At
this point, Uncle Remus paused and glanced at the little boy, who was
listening to the story with almost breathless interest. âYou ainât got
yoâ hankcher wid you, is you?â the old man inquired gently.

âMother always makes me carry a handkerchief,â the child replied, âand it
makes the pocket of my jacket stick out. Why did you ask, Uncle Remus?â

âKaze we er cominâ ter de place whar youâll need it,â said the old man.
âYou better take it out anâ holâ it in yoâ hanâ. Ef you got any tears
inside er you, deyâll come ter de top now.â

The child took out his handkerchief, and held it in his hand obediently.
âWell, suh,â Uncle Remus went on, âatter dey been made âquainted, olâ
Craney-Crow tell Dock Wolf âbout his troubles, anâ how he wanter do like
de rest er de flyinâ creeturs, anâ Dock Wolf rub his chin anâ put his
thumb in his wescut pocket fer all de worlâ like a sho nuff doctor. He
say ter olâ Craney-Crow dat he ainât so mighty certain anâ sho dat he
kin heâp âim much. He say dat in all his born days he ainât never see
no flyinâ creetur wid sech a long neck, anâ dat heâll hatter be mighty
intickler how he fool wid it. He went close, he did, anâ feel un it anâ
fumble wid it, anâ all de time his mouf wuz waterinâ des like yone do

âHe say: âYouâll hatter holâ yoâ head lower, Mr. Craney-Crow,â anâ wid
dat he snap down on it, anâ dat wuz de last er dat Craney-Crow. He
ainât never see his home no moâ, anâ moâ dan dat, olâ Dock Wolf slung
âim âcross his back anâ cantered off home. Anâ datâs de reason dat de
Craney-Crows all fly so fasâ when dey come thoo dis part er de country.â

âBut why did you ask me to take out my handkerchief, Uncle Remus?â

âKaze I wanter be on de safe side,â remarked the old man with much
solemnity. âEf you got a hankcher when you cry, you kin wipe off de
weeps, anâ you kin hide de puckers in yoâ face.â

BROTHER FOX FOLLOWS THE FASHION


The little boy was not sure whether Uncle Remus had finished the story;
it would have been hard for a grown man to keep up with the whimsical
notions of the venerable old darkey, and surely you couldnât expect a
little bit of a boy, who had had no experience to speak of, to do as
well. The little lad waited a while, and, seeing that Uncle Remus showed
no sign of resuming the narrative, he spoke up. âI didnât see anything to
cry about,â he remarked.

âWell, some folks cries, anâ yuther folks laughs. Dey got der reasons,
too. Now, I dunno dat olâ Brer Rabbit wuz hard-hearted er colâ-blooded
any moâ dan de common run er de creeturs, but it look like he kin see
moâ ter tickle âim dan ye yuthers, anâ he wuz constant a-laughinâ. Mosâ
er de time heâd laugh in his innerds, but den agâin, when sumpân tetch
his funny-bone, heâd open up wid a big ha-ha-ha dat âud make de yuther
creeturs take ter de bushes.

âAnâ dat âuz de way he done when olâ Craney-Crow had his head tooken off
fer ter be in de fashion. He laugh anâ laugh twel it hurt âim ter laugh,
anâ den he laugh some moâ fer good medjur. He laughed plum twel morninâ,
anâ den he laugh whiles he wuz rackinâ on todes home. Heâd lope a little
ways, anâ den heâd set down by de side er de road anâ laugh some moâ.
Whiles he gwine on dis a-way, he come ter de place whar Brer Fox live at,
anâ den it look like he canât git no furder. Ef a leaf shook on de tree,
it âud put âim in minâ er de hoppinâ anâ jumpinâ anâ scufflinâ dat olâ
Craney-Crow done when Dock Wolf tuck anâ tuck off his head fer âim.

âEz luck would have it, Brer Fox wuz out in his pea-patch fer ter see
how his crap wuz gittinâ on, anâ huntinâ rounâ fer ter see ef dey wuz any
stray tracks whar somebody had bin atter his truck. Whiles he wuz lookinâ
rounâ he hear some un laughinâ fit ter kill, anâ he looked over de fence
fer ter see who âtis. Dar wuz Brer Rabbit des a-rollinâ in de grass anâ
laughinâ hard ez he kin. Brer Fox âlow: âHeyo, Brer Rabbit! what de name
er goodness de matter wid you?â Brer Rabbit, in de middle er his laughinâ
canât do nothinâ but shake his head anâ kick in de grass.

ââBout dat time, olâ Miss Fox stuck âer head outân de winder fer ter see
what gwine on. She say, âSandy, what all dat fuss out dar? Ainât you know
dat de babyâs des gone ter sleep?â Brer Fox, he say, ââTainât nobody in
de rounâ worlâ but Brer Rabbit, anâ ef I ainât mighty much mistooken, he
done gone anâ got a case er de highstericks.â Olâ Miss Fox say, âI donât
keer what he got, I wish heâd go on âway fum dar, er hush up his racket.
Heâll wake de chillun, anâ dem what ainât âsleep heâll skeer de wits
outân âum.â

âWid dat, olâ Brer Rabbit cotch his breff, anâ pass de time er day wid
Brer Fox anâ his olâ âoman. Den he say, âYou see me anâ you hear me, Brer
Fox; well, des ez you see me now, dat de way I been gwine on all night
long. I speck maybe it ainât right fer ter laugh at dem what ainât got
de sense dey oughter been born wid, but I canât heâp it fer ter save my
life; I try, but de moâ what I try de wusser I gits. I oughter be at
home right now, anâ I would be ef it hadnât âaâ been fer sumpân I seed
lasâ night,â anâ den he went ter laughinâ agâin. Olâ Miss Fox, she fix
de bonnet on her head, anâ den she say, âWhat you see, Brer Rabbit? It
musâ be mighty funny; tell us âbout it, anâ maybe weâll laugh wid you.â
Brer Rabbit âlow, âI donât minâ tellinâ you, maâam, ef I kin keep fum
laughinâ, but ef I hatter stop fer ter ketch my breff, I know mighty well
dat youâll skuzen me.â Olâ Miss Fox say, âDat we will, Brer Rabbit.â

âWid dat Brer Rabbit up anâ tolâ all âbout olâ Craney-Crow cominâ in de
Swamp, anâ not knowinâ how ter go ter bed. He say dat de funny part un
it wuz dat olâ Craney-Crow ainât know dat when anybody went ter bed dey
oughter take der head off, anâ den he start ter laughinâ agâin. Olâ Miss
Fox look at her olâ man anâ he look at her; dey dunner what ter say er
how ter say it.

âBrer Rabbit see how dey er doinâ, but he ainât pay no âtention. He
âlow, âDat olâ Craney-Crow look like he had travel fur anâ wide; he look
like he know what all de fashions is, but when he got in de Swamp anâ see
all de creeturs--dem what run anâ dem what fly--sleepinâ wid der heads
off, he shoâ wuz tuck back; he say he ainât never her er sech doinâs ez
dat. You done seed how country folks do--well, des dat a-way he done.
I been tryinâ hard fer ter git home, anâ tell my olâ âoman âbout it,
but eveây time I gits a good start it pop up in my minâ âbout how olâ
Craney-Crow done when he finâ out what de fashion wuz in dis part er de
country.â Anâ den Brer Rabbit sot inter laughinâ, and Brer Fox anâ olâ
Miss Fox dey jâined in wid âim, kaze dey ainât want nobody fer ter git de
idee dat dey donât know what de fashion is, speshually de fashion in de
part er de country whar dey er livinâ at.

âOlâ Miss Fox, she say dat olâ Craney-Crow must be a funny sort er
somebody not ter know what de fashions is, anâ Brer Fox he âgree twel he
grin anâ show his tushes. He say he ainât keerinâ much âbout fashions
hisseâf, but he wouldnât like fer ter be laughed at on de âcount er
plain ignunce. Brer Rabbit, he say he ainât makinâ no pertence er doinâ
eveâything datâs done, kaze he ainât dat finnicky, but when fashions is
comfertubble anâ coolinâ he donât minâ follerinâ um fer der own sake ez
well ez hisân. He say now dat he done got in de habits er sleepinâ wid
his head off, he wouldnât no moâ sleep wid it on dan heâd fly.

âOlâ Miss Fox, she up ânâ sponâ, âI bâlieve you, Brer Rabbit--dat I
does!â Brer Rabbit, he make a bow, he did, anâ âlow, âI know mighty well
dat Iâm olâ-fashionâ, anâ dey ainât no ânyinâ it, Miss Fox, but when de
new gineration hit on ter sumpân datâs cool anâ comfertubble, I ainât de
man ter laugh at it des kaze itâs tollerbul new. No, maâam! Iâll try it,
anâ ef it work all right Iâll foller it; ef it donât, I wonât. De fusâ
time I try ter sleep wid my head off I wuz kinder nervious, but I soon
got over dat, anâ now ef it wuz ter go out fashion, Iâd des keep right
on wid it, I donât keer what de yuthers âd think. Datâs me; datâs me all
over.â

âBimeby, Brer Rabbit look at de sun, anâ des vow he bleeze ter git home.
He wish olâ Miss Fox mighty well, anâ made his bow, anâ put out down de
road at a two-forty gait. Brer Fox look kinder sheepish when his olâ
âoman look at âim. He say dat de idee er sleepinâ wid yoâ head off is
bran new ter him. Olâ Miss Fox âlow dat deyâs a heap er things in dis
worlâ what he dunno, anâ what he wonât never finâ out. She say, âHere I
is a-scrimpinâ anâ a-workinâ my eyeballs out fer ter be ez good ez de
besâ, anâ dar you is a projickinâ rounâ anâ not a-keerinâ whedder yoâ
fambly is in de fashion er not.â Brer Fox âlow dat ef sleepinâ wid yoâ
head off is one er de fashions, he fer one ainât keerinâ âbout tryinâ.
Olâ Miss Fox say, âNo, anâ you ainât a-keerinâ what folks say âbout
yoâ wife anâ fambly. No wonder Brer Rabbit had ter laugh whiles he wuz
tellinâ you âbout Craney-Crow, kaze you stood dar wid yoâ mouf open like
you ainât got no sense. Itâll be a purty tale heâll tell his fambly âbout
de tacky Fox fambly.â

âWid dat Olâ Miss Fox switch away fum de winder anâ went ter cleaninâ
up de house, anâ bimeby Brer Fox went in de house hopinâ dat brekfus wuz
ready; but dey waânât no sign er nothinâ ter eat. Atter so long a time,
Brer Fox ax when he wuz gwine ter git brekfusâ. His olâ âoman âlow dat
eatinâ brekfusâ anâ gittinâ it, too, wuz one er de fashions. Ef he ainât
follerinâ fashions, she ainât needer. He ainât say no moâ, but went off
behinâ de house anâ had a mighty time er thinkinâ anâ scratchinâ fer
fleas.

âWhen bedtime come, olâ Miss Fox wuz mighty tired, anâ she ainât
a-keerinâ much âbout fashions right den. Des ez she wuz fixinâ fer ter
roll âerseâf in de kivver, Brer Fox come in fum a hunt heâd been havinâ.
He fotch a weasel anâ a mink wid âim, anâ he put um in de cubberd whar
deyâd keep cool. Den he wash his face anâ hanâs, anâ âlow dat heâs ready
fer ter have his head tooken off fer de night, ef his olâ âomanâll be so
good ez ter heâp âim.

âBy dat time olâ Miss Fox had done got over de pouts, but she ainât got
over de idee er follerinâ atter de fashions, anâ so she say sheâll be
glad fer ter heâp âim do whatâs right, seeinâ dat heâs so hard-headed
in ginâul. Den come de knotty part. Naâer one un um knowâd what dey wuz
âbout, anâ dar dey sot anâ jowered âbout de besâ way fer ter git de head
off. Brer Fox say dey ainât but one way, lessân you twisâ de head off,
anâ goodness knows he ainât want nobody fer ter be twisâinâ his neck,
kaze he ticklish anyhow. Dat one way wuz ter take de ax anâ cut de head
off. Olâ Miss Fox, she squall, she did, anâ holâ up her hanâs like she
skeerâd.

âBrer Fox sot dar lookinâ up de chimbley. Bimeby his olâ âoman âlow, âDe
ax look mighty skeery, but one thing I know, anâ dat ainât two, it ainât
gwineter hurt you ef itâs de fashion. Brer Fox kinder work his under jaw,
but he ainât sayinâ nothinâ. So his olâ âoman went out ter de woodpile
anâ got de ax, anâ den she say, âIâm ready, honey, whenever you is,â anâ
Brer Fox, he âsponâ, âIâm des ez ready now ez I ever is ter be,â anâ wid
dat she up wid de ax anâ _blip!_ she tuck âim right on de neck. De head
come right off wid little er no trouble, anâ olâ Miss Fox laugh anâ say
ter herseâf dat she glad dey follerinâ de fashion at lasâ.

âBrer Fox sorter kick anâ squirm when de head fusâ come off, but his olâ
âoman âlow dat dat wuz de sign he wuz dreaminâ, anâ atter he lay right
still she say he wuz havinâ a better nightâs resâ dan what heâd had in a
mighty long time. Anâ den she happen fer ter think dat whiles her olâ man
done gone anâ got in de fashion, dar she wuz ready fer ter go ter bed wid
âer head on. She dunner how ter git âer head off, anâ she try ter wake up
her olâ man, but it look like he wuz one er dem stubborn kinder sleepers
what wonât be wokenâd atter dey once drap off. She shake âim anâ holler
at âim, but âtainât do no good. She canât make âim stir, spite er all de
racket she make, anâ she hatter go ter bed wid her head on.

âShe went ter bed, she did, but she ainât sleep good, kaze she had
trouble in de minâ. Sheâd wake up anâ turn over, anâ roll anâ toss, anâ
wonder what de yuther creetursâd say ef dey knowâd she wuz so far outer
de fashion ez ter sleep wid âer head on. Anâ she had bad dreams; she
dremp dat Brer Rabbit wuz laughinâ at âer, anâ she start fer ter run at
âim, anâ de fust news she knowâd de dogs wuz on her trail anâ gwine in
full cry. âTwuz dat a-way all night long, anâ she wuz moâ dan thankful
when morninâ come.

[Illustration: â_So his olâ âoman went out ter de woodpile anâ got de

âShe try ter wake up her olâ man, but still he wonât be woke. He lay dar,
he did, anâ wonât budge, anâ bimeby olâ Miss Fox git mad anâ go off anâ
leave âim. Atter so long a time she went back ter whar he wuz layinâ, anâ
he wuz des like she lefâ âim. She try ter roust âim up, but he wonât be
rousted. She holler so loud dat Brer Rabbit which he wuz gwine by, got de
idee dat she wuz callinâ him, anâ he stick his head in de doâ anâ âlow,
âIs you callinâ me, maâam?â

âShe say, âLa! Brer Rabbit? I ainât know you wuz anywheres arounâ. I been

you ter drag âim out anâ git âim up.â

âBrer Rabbit say, âEf dey ainât nothinâ de matter wid Brer Fox heâll git
up in good time.â Olâ Miss Fox âlow, âLa! I dunner what you call good
time. Look at de sun--itâs âway up yander, anâ dar he is sleepinâ like a
log. âFoâ he went ter bed he made me take his head off, anâ he ainât woke
up sence.â âAnâ how did you git it off, mum?â sez olâ Brer Rabbit, sezee.
âI tuck anâ tuck de ax anâ cut it off,â seâshe. Wid dat Brer Rabbit flung
bofe hanâs over his face, anâ mosied off like he wuz cryinâ. Fum de way
he look youâd âaâ thunk his heart wuz broke; yit he waânât cryinâ.â

âThen what was he doing, Uncle Remus?â the little boy asked.

âDes a-laughinâ--laughinâ fit ter kill. When olâ Miss Fox see âim gwine
long like he wuz cryinâ, she spicionâd dat sumpân wuz wrong, anâ sho

âI take notice, honey, dat you ainât use yoâ hankcher yit. What de matter
wid you? Is yoâ weeps all dry up?â

The child laughed and stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket.

IX

WHY THE TURKEY BUZZARD IS BALD-HEADED


âMother,â said the little boy one day, âdo you know why the turkey
buzzards are bald?â

âWhy, no,â replied the young mother, very much surprised. âI didnât even
know they were bald. But why do you ask such a silly question?â

âBecause Uncle Remus said you knew why they are bald.â

âYou tell Uncle Remus,â said the grandmother, laughing heartily, âthat I
say he is an old rascal, and he had better behave himself.â

The way of it was this: The little boy had been walking out in the
fields with Uncle Remus, and had seen, away up in the sky, two or three
turkey buzzards floating lazily along on motionless wings. From the
fields they had gone into the woods, and in these woods they had found
what Uncle Remus had said was a buzzardâs nest. It was in a hollow tree,
flat on the ground, and when they came near, the mother buzzard issued
forth from the hollow, with such a hissing and flapping of wings that the
little boy was frightened for a moment.

âGo on âway fum here, you bald-headed olâ rapscallion; ef you donât Iâll
do you wuss dan Brer Rabbit done you. Honey,â he went on, turning to the
child, âyou better put yoâ hankcher ter yoâ nose ef you gwineter look in
dat nesâ, kaze olâ Miss Turkey Buzzard is a scandalious housekeeper.â

The child did as he was bid, and, peeping in the nest, he saw two young
ones, as white as goslings. While he was peeping in he got a whiff of the
odor of the buzzards, and turned and ran away from the place as hard as
he could. Uncle Remus followed suit, and hobbled away as fast as his legs
could carry him. When they were both out of range of the buzzardâs nest,
they stopped and laughed at each other.

âYou neeânter be skeerâd dat anythingâll ketch you, honey. Dey ainât
nothinâ but a race-hoss got yoâ gait. Why, ef I hadnât âaâ been wid you,
youâd âaâ been home by now, kaze youâd âaâ started when olâ Miss Buzzard
fus flew out er dat hole.â

The little boy made no denial, for he knew that what Uncle Remus said had
much more than a grain of truth in it. Besides, he was thinking of other
things just then. He soon made known what it was. âWhy did you call the
buzzard bald-headed, Uncle Remus?â

âA mighty good reason,â responded the old man. âDey ainât no moâ got
fedders on de top er der head dan you got haâr in de paâm er yoâ hanâ.
You ketch one un um, anâ ef you kin holâ yoâ breff long nuff ter look,
youâll see dat Iâm tellinâ you de trufe. I ainât blaminâ um fer dat,
kaze dey got a mighty good reason fer beinâ balâ-headed. Deyâs mighty
few folks dat know what de reason is, anâ one un um is yoâ ma. Ef youâll
kinder coax âer, I speck sheâll tell you.â

This was what led up to the question the child had asked his mother, and
was the occasion of the grandmotherâs laughing remark that Uncle Remus
was an old rascal.

The little boy gave Uncle Remus the full particulars the next time he
saw him. The old man laughed merrily when he heard that his Miss Sally
had called him an old rascal. âTalk âbout yoâ smart wimmen folks!â he
exclaimed. âDey ainât naâer man in de worlâ what kin holâ a candle ter
yoâ granâma; anâ des ez you see âer now, dat des de way she been sence
she wuz a gal. She know what you gwineter say long âfoâ you kin git de
words out ân yoâ mouf; she kin look right thoo you anâ tell you what you
thinkinâ âbout. You may laugh all you wanter, but ef youer feelinâ bad
sheâll know it. When Miss Sally goes anâ dies, dey wonât be naâer nudder
somebody fer ter take her place. Dey ainât no two ways âbout dat.â

âI think she is getting used to mother,â the little boy remarked in his
old-fashioned way--a way that was a source of constant amazement to Uncle
Remus, who could hardly understand how a child could act and talk like
a grown person. He regarded the child with a puzzled look, and closed
his eyes with a sigh. The child had no idea that Uncle Remus was either
puzzled or amazed, and so he harked back to the original problem. âWhy is
the buzzard bald-headed?â he asked.

âEf yoâ ma anâ yoâ granâma dunno,â replied Uncle Remus, âI speck Iâll
hatter tell you, anâ de besâ way ter do dat is ter tell de tale dat de
olâ folks tolâ der chillun. What make it moâ easy, is dat dey ainât
nothinâ er Brer Turkey Buzzard in it but his name. Ef he wuz in it
hisseâf, I donât speck youâd stay long nuff fer ter hear me tell it.â The
child laughed, for he remembered how he wanted to run away from the tree
when old Mrs. Buzzard came flopping out. He laughed, but said nothing,
and Uncle Remus resumed:

âDey wuz a time when Brer Rabbit live in one side uv a holler tree. One
day whiles he wuz gwine pirootinâ rounâ, olâ Miss Turkey Buzzard come
knockinâ at de doâ, anâ when she donât hear nothinâ she stuck âer head
in anâ look rounâ. Ter see âer den anâ see âer now you wouldnât know she
wuz de same creetur. She had a fine top-knot on âer head, bigger dan de
one on de freezlinâ hen, which de winâ done blow all her fedders de wrong
way. Yasser, she had a fine top-knot, anâ she âuz purty good-lookinâ.

âWell, suh, she peeped in, she did, anâ den she seed dat dey waânât
nobody in dar, needer Grandaddy Owl, ner Brer Polecat, ner Brer

âDis âuz too much fer olâ Miss Buzzard, anâ she say, âI thank you

âDey went on dat a-way, âsputinâ âbout de seck twel olâ Miss Buzzard
âgun ter git sleepy. She say, âBrer Rabbit, ef you took moâ time for
sleep, youâd be lots better off.â Brer Rabbit âlow, âMaybe so--maybe
so, Sis Buzzard, but I canât help my habits. Iâm a light sleeper, but I
wuz born so, anâ if you so much ez move endurinâ er de night Iâll have
one eye open.â Olâ Miss Buzzard say, âEf datâs de case, Brer Rabbit,
Iâll thank you fer ter wake me ef you hear a snake crawlinâ. Dey ainât
many things Iâm afeard un, anâ one uv um is a snake.â Brer Rabbit laugh

âDat âuz de fust night,â said Uncle Remus, flinging away a quid of
tobacco and taking a fresh one. âBy de nexâ day olâ Miss Buzzard had done
took up her âbode anâ lodginâ whar Brer Rabbit wuz livinâ at. He ainât

BROTHER DEER ANâ KING SUNâS DAUGHTER


It is only fair to say that the little boy came to the plantation
somewhat prejudiced. His mother, had never known the advantages of
association with the old-time negroes, and was a great stickler for
accuracy of speech. She was very precise in the use of English and could
not abide the simple dialect in which the stories had been related to the
little boyâs father. She was so insistent in this matter that the childâs
father, when asked for a story such as Uncle Remus had told him, thought
it best to avoid the dialect that he knew so well. In consequence, the
essence of the stories was dissipated for the child, and he lacked the
enthusiasm which Uncle Remus had hoped to find.

But this enthusiasm came by degrees as Uncle Remus wandered from one
tale to another. The child never told his mother how he enjoyed the
stories, and yet he came to play the part that had been played by his
father long before he was born, and matters came to such a pass, that,
if he was long with Uncle Remus without hearing a story, he straightway
imagined that the old man was angry or out of sorts. The lad was gaining
in health and strength every day he remained on the plantation, and in
consideration of this fact--and as the result of wise diplomacy of Uncle
Remus--the childâs mother relaxed the discipline that she had thought
necessary for his welfare, so that not many weeks elapsed before his
cheeks became ruddy with health. Uncle Remus hailed him as a town rowdy,
and declared that the plantation would soon be too small to hold him.

âI pity yoâ granâma,â said Uncle Remus, âkaze ef you stay rounâ here,
sheâll hatter buy all de âjâininâ plantations ef she gwineter keep you on
her lanâ.â

There was no more corn to be hauled, but there was harness to be mended,
and the little boy, sitting on a high stool in the workshop, or leaning
against Uncle Remus, watched the operation with great interest. He
observed one day that the old man was frowning darkly. His forehead was
puckered into knots and seamed with wrinkles that did not belong there,
and his eyebrows were drawn together over his nose.

âWhat is the matter with you, Uncle Remus? Are you angry, or are you
going to cry?â

âIâll tell you de trufe, honey. Iâm mighty nigh on de pâint er cryinâ.
You see my face puckered up, donât you? Well, ef you had ez much on yoâ
minâ ez what I got on mine, youâd be boo-hooinâ same ez a baby. I tell
you dat. Anâ des ter show you dat Iâm in deep trouble, Iâll ax you ter
tell me how many times dey is.â

âHow many times? How many times what?â the child inquired.

Uncle Remus regarded him sorrowfully, and then returned to his work
with a heavy sigh. âDid I ax you âbout what? No, I ainât; I axâd you
âbout times. I say ez plain ez writinâ: âHow many times is dey?â anâ you
âsponâ, âHow many times what?â It look mighty funny ter me. Darâs daytime
anâ night-time, bedtime anâ meal-time, anâ some time anâ no time, anâ
high time anâ fly time, anâ long time anâ wrong time, âsimmon time anâ
plum time. Dey ainât no use er talkinâ; itâs nuff fer ter make yoâ head
swim. I been tryinâ fer ter count um up, but de moâ I count um up de moâ
dey is.â

The little boy looked at the old man with a half-smile on his face. He
was plainly puzzled, but he didnât like to admit it even to himself. âWhy
do you want to know how many times there are?â he asked.

âKaze I wanter live anâ lâarn,â replied Uncle Remus. âLeâ me see,â he
went on, puckering his face again. âDars de olâ time anâ de new time, de
colâ time anâ de due time--bless yoâ soul, honey, I canât count um up.
No, suh; youâll hatter skusen me!â

He paused and looked at the little boy to see what the child could make
out of all he had said.

He saw nothing in the small countenance but curiosity. âWhat made you
think of it?â was the question the child asked.

âMosâ eveâything I see make me think âbout it, anâ youâll think âbout
it youâseâf, when you come ter be olâ ez what I is. But de reason it
wuz runninâ in my head dis time wuz kaze I start ter tell a tale widout
knowinâ when de time wuz. I know it wuz âway back yander, but de montâ er
de year I canât tell, anâ when I try ter fix on de time eveâything look
dim anâ smoky, anâ I say ter myseâf dat dey musâ be a fog in my mind.â

âCanât you tell the story unless you can find out about the time?â
inquired the little boy.

âTooby shoâ I kin, honey; but youâd bâlieve it lots quicker ef you knowâd
what time it happen. âFoâ yoâ great-granâma died she had a trunk full er
ollymenacks, anâ I bounâ you ef I had âem here whar you could look at um,
we wouldnât have no trouble. I speck dey done got strowâd about endurinâ
er de war time.

âWell, anyhow, once âpon a time, when dey wuz mighty few folks in de
worlâ, ef any, Brer Deer fell in love wid olâ King Sunâs daughter.â
Having made this preliminary statement, Uncle Remus paused to see what
effect it had on the child. Amazement and incredulity were written on
the little boyâs face, observing which the old man smiled. âYou neeânter
git de idee in yoâ head dat olâ King Sun is like he wuz in dem days. No,
bless you! He wuz des ez diffunt ez dem times wuz fum deze times, anâ
when you git ter readinâ in de books youâll finâ out what de diffunce
wuz. He wuz closer by, anâ he ainât hide out at night like he does now.
He wuz up in de sky, but he ainât live ez high up; he wuz moâ neighborly,
ez you may say.

âHe live so close by dat he useter senâ de house-gal down ter de spring
fer drinkinâ-water. Three times a day sheâd come ter fetch it; sheâd
clime down wid de bucket in her hanâ anâ sheâd clime back wid de bucket
on her head, anâ sheâd sing bofe ways, cominâ anâ gwine. In dem times
dey all knowâd dat olâ King Sun had a daughter, but dey ainât know what
âer name is; anâ dey know she wuz purty. Well, Brer Deer he hear talk un
âer, anâ he tuck a notion dat he gwineter marry âer, but he dunner how he
gwineter git up dar whar she live at. He study anâ study, but he canât
finâ no way.

âHe was settinâ down by de road studyinâ out a plan fer ter git word ter
de gal, when olâ Brer Rabbit come lopinâ down de lane. He musâ a been
playinâ hoss, kaze when he see Brer Deer, he shied anâ sneezed, he did,
anâ make like he gwineter run away. But he ainât run. He pass de time
er day wid Brer Deer anâ ax âim how his copperosity seem to segashuate.
Brer Deer âlow dat his copperosity is segashuatinâ all right, but he got
trouble in his minâ anâ he canât git it out. He looked mighty sollumcolly
when he say dis, anâ Brer Rabbit say he sorry.

âHe sot down, Brer Rabbit did, anâ cross his legs, anâ rub his chin same
like de doctor do when he gwineter slap a dose er bitter truck on yoâ
insides. He rub his chin, he did, anâ look like he know all dey is fer
ter be knowâd. He say, âBrer Deer, when I wuz growinâ up I useter hear
de olâ folks say dat a light heart made a long life, anâ I bâlieve um.
I shoâ does. Dey knowâd what dey wuz talkinâ âbout, kaze I done had de
speunce un it.

âBrer Deer shuck his head anâ grieve. Ef heâd âaâ had a hankcher, he
âaâ had need un it right den anâ dar, but he wink his eye fasâ fer ter
git de tears out ân um. He âlow, âI speck youer tellinâ me de trufe,
Brer Rabbit, but I canât heâp it ef you is. I am what I am, anâ I canât
be no ammer. I feels moâ like cryinâ dan I does like eatinâ, anâ Iâm
dat fractious dat I canât skacely see straight. Olâ Mr. Ram tolâ me
howdy a while ago, anâ I ainât done a thing but run at âim an butt him
slonchways. You neeânter tell me dat I ainât got no business fer ter do
dat a-way; I des canât heâp it.â

âBrer Rabbit kinder edge hisseâf away fum Brer Deer. He say, âDat beinâ
de case, Brer Deer, I speck I better giâ you moâ room. When I lefâ
home dis morninâ my olâ âoman âlow: âYou better take keer er yoâseâf,
honey,â anâ Iâm gwineter do dat identual thing. I dunno dat Iâm skeered
er gittinâ hurted, but Iâm monstus ticklish when de horned creeturs is
rounâ.â Brer Deer say: âYou neeânter be fearâd er me, Brer Rabbit. I been
knowinâ you a long time, anâ manyâs de night dat we bofe graze in de
same pasturâ, you a-nibblinâ on de green grass anâ me a-crappinâ it. Iâm
monstus glad I run âcross you, kaze ef I canât tell my troubles ter some
un, I bâlieve in my soul Iâll bust wide open.â

âWid dat Brer Deer went on fer ter tell Brer Rabbit dat he done fell
dead in love wid olâ King Sunâs daughter. He dunner how come it ter be
so, but anyhow so it is. He ainât had no talk wid âer; he ainât moâ dan
cotch a glimpâ er de gal, yet dar he wuz dead in love wid âer. Brer
Rabbit mought laugh at âim ef he wanter; heâll des set dar anâ take it.
He talk anâ talk, he did, twel Brer Rabbit got right sorry fer âim. He
sot dar, he did, anâ study, anâ he tell Brer Deer dat heâll heâp âim ef
he kin, anâ he mosâ know he kin.

[Illustration: â_Brer Deer went on fer ter tell Brer Rabbit_â]

âBrer Deer raise his head, anâ open his eyes. He say, âBrer Rabbit, you
âstonish me--you shoâ does. Ef youâll heâp me out in dis, Iâll stanâ by
you thoo thick anâ thin.â But Brer Rabbit say he ainât doinâ it fer no
pay; he done lay by his crap, anâ he ainât got nothinâ much ter do, anâ
he say heâll heâp Brer Deer des fer ter keep his hanâ in. Brer Deer look
like he wuz mightâly holp up. Fust he smole a smile, anâ den he broke out
in a laugh. He say, âYouer de man fer my money!â

âBrer Rabbit kinder wiggle his nose. He say, âEf you keep yoâ money twel
you think you got too much, youâll have it by you fer many a long year
ter come.â Wid dat, he got up anâ bresh de dusâ offân his britches, anâ
shuck hanâs wid Brer Deer. He say, âI hope fer ter have some good news
fer you de nexâ time we meet in de big road.â He bowed, he did, anâ den
off he put, lippity-clip. He look back fer ter see ef Brer Deer wuz
follerinâ âim, but Brer Deer had sense ânuff fer ter hunt âim a cool
place in de woods, whar he kin take de fust nap what he had in many a
night anâ day.

âBrer Rabbit lope off todes de spring, kaze he knowâd dat de spring wuz
de place whar King Sunâs house-gal come atter water--anâ she hatter tote
a mighty heap un it. It look like de moâ water what King Sun drunk de
moâ he want, anâ dat beinâ de case, de gal had âbout ez much totinâ ez
she kin do. Brer Rabbit went down ter de spring, but dey waânât nobody
dar, anâ he look in it anâ see hisseâf in de water. Dar he wuz, his haâr
all comb, his face clean, anâ he look slicker dan sin. He laugh, he
did, anâ say ter de Rabbit what he see in de water, âYou shoâ is mighty
good-lookinâ, whoever you is, anâ ef you blame anybody, donât blame me,
kaze I canât heâp it.â

âNow, down at de bottom er de spring wuz olâ man Spring Lizzard. He wuz
takinâ his morninâ nap, when we hear some un talkinâ. He raise up, he
did, anâ lissen; den he look anâ see Brer Rabbit lookinâ at hisseâf in
de water, anâ he holler out, âMaybe you ainât ez good-lookinâ ez you
think you is.â Brer Rabbit holler back, âHello, dar! dis is de fus time I
knowâd dat yoâ shadder in de water kin talk back at you.â

âWid dat, Mr. Spring Lizzard come fum under de green moss, anâ float ter
de top er de water. He pass de time er day wid Brer Rabbit, anâ ax âim
whar he gwine, anâ what he gwine ter do when he git dar. Brer Rabbit âlow
dat he tryinâ fer ter do a good turn ter a frienâ whatâs in trouble anâ
den he went on anâ tolâ de olâ Spring Lizzard âbout Brer Deer anâ King
Sunâs daughter. De Spring Lizzard say sheâs a mighty likely gal, kaze
he seed her one time when she slip off anâ come wid de house-gal atter
water. He say she got long haâr dat look like spun silk, anâ eyes dat
shine like de morninâ star.

âBrer Rabbit say he donât âspute it, but what he wanter know is how he
kin git word ter King Sun âbout Brer Deer. De Spring Lizzard say datâs
easy. He say dat when de house-gal come atter water, she hatter let down
de step-ladder, anâ Brer Rabbit kin slip by âer anâ go up, er he hisseâf
kin git in de bucket anâ go up. Brer Rabbit say he kinder jubâus âbout
gwine, kaze heâs a kinder home body, anâ den de Spring Lizzard âlow dat
ef Brer Deer will write a note, heâll take it.

âWell, Brer Deer canât write anâ Brer Rabbit kin; so dey fix it up
âtwixâ um, anâ âtwant long âfoâ dey had de note writ, anâ Brer Rabbit
tuck it anâ giâ it ter de Spring Lizzard. He say, âDonât let it git wet,
whatever you does,â and de Spring Lizzard ax how it gwineter git wet when
he put it in his pocket? He say dat eveâybody but him, de fishes anâ de
frogs got a wrong idee âbout water, kaze âtainât wet ez it mought be,
âceppinâ on a rainy day.

âTime went on des like it do now; night swung by anâ day swung in, anâ
here come King Sunâs house-gal atter a bucket er water. She let down de
step-ladder anâ come singinâ ter de spring. She drapped her bucket in,
anâ de Spring Lizzard stepped in, anâ crope rounâ ter whar de shadder
wuz de heaviest. De gal clomb up de step-ladder, anâ pulled it atter
her, anâ went âlong de path ter King Sunâs house. She took de water in
de settinâ-room fer ter giâ King Sun a fresh drink, anâ he grabbed up de
gourd anâ drunk anâ drunk twel it look like he gwineter bust. Atter dat
he went in de liberry, anâ de Spring Lizzard crope out anâ lefâ Brer Deer
note on de table, anâ den he crope back in de bucket.

âAtter while, King Sunâs daughter come bouncinâ in de room atter a
drink er water, anâ she see de note. She grab it up anâ read it, anâ den
she holler: âPa, oh, pa! hereâs a letter fer you, anâ I mosâ know deyâs
sumpân in it âbout me! La! I dunner who âtis datâs got de impidence fer
ter put my name in a letter.â Olâ King Sun run his fingers thoo his
beard, des like he combinâ it, anâ den he cleâr up his thoat. He take
de letter anâ holâ it off fum âim, anâ den put on his specks. He âlow,
âWell, well, well! whoâd a thunk it?â anâ den he look at his daughter.
She look at de floâ anâ pat âer foot. He say, âI ainât never hear er sech
impidence.â De gal âlow, âWhat do he say, pa?â Wid dat, he hanâ âer de
letter, anâ when she read it, she got red in de face, anâ den she got
white. She think one way, anâ den she think anâer. She got mad anâ she
got glad, anâ den she had de all-overs, des like gals does deze days when
some un ax um fer ter have um.

âSo den, dar âtwuz; Brer Deer want ter marry de gal, anâ de gal dunner
whedder she wanter marry er not. Den olâ King Sun got his pen, anâ put a
little water in de ink, kaze it wuz mighty nigh dried up, anâ den he writ
a letter back ter Brer Deer. He say dat ef de one what writ de letter
will senâ âim a bag er gold, he kin have de gal. He folâ de letter up anâ
hanâ it ter de gal, anâ she not knowinâ what else ter do, tuck anâ put it
on de table whar she finâ de yuther one.

âDe Spring Lizzard had his eye on âer, anâ when she went outân de room,
he clomb up on de table anâ got de letter, anâ went back in de bucket
agâin. Dat eveninâ de house-gal hatter fetch water fer de night, anâ she
let down de step-ladder anâ went ter de spring. When she dip de bucket
in, de Spring Lizzard, he slide out, anâ went ter his bed unâ de long
green moss. âTwant long âfoâ Brer Rabbit had de letter, anâ atter dat,
âtwant no time âfoâ Brer Deer knowâd what de intents wuz. âTwixâ anâ
âtwen um dey got up a bag er gold, anâ Brer Rabbit tuck it ter de spring
whar de house-gal got water.

âDe nexâ morninâ de daughter come âerseâf, kaze she wanter see what
kinder man Brer Deer is. At de spring she finâ a bag er gold. She clap
âer hanâs anâ holler out: âLook what I finâ--finâ, finâ, finây! Itâs
minâ--minâ, minâ, minây!â Brer Rabbit wuz settinâ in de bushes, anâ Brer
Deer waânât fur off, anâ dey bofe watch de gal a-prancinâ anâ dancinâ;
anâ den, bimeby Brer Deer went out whar she kin see âim, anâ he des walk
up ter âer anâ say, âLook what I finâ; honey, youer mine!â Anâ dat âuz de
way Brer Deer got olâ King Sunâs daughter.â

BROTHER RABBITâS CRADLE


âI wish youâd tell me what you tote a hankcher fer,â remarked Uncle
Remus, after he had reflected over the matter a little while.

âWhy, to keep my mouth clean,â answered the little boy.

Uncle Remus looked at the lad, and shook his head doubtfully. âUh-uh!â
he exclaimed. âYou canât fool folks when dey git ez olâ what I is. I been
watchinâ you now moâ days dan I kin count, anâ I ainât never see yoâ mouf
dirty ânuff fer ter be wiped wid a hankcher. Itâs allers clean--too clean
ter suit me. Darâs yoâ pa, now; when he wuz a little chap like you, his
mouf useter git dirty in de morninâ anâ stay dirty plum twel night. Dey
waâ scaâcely a day dat he didnât look like he been playinâ wid de pigs in
de stable lot. Ef he yever is tote a hankcher, he ainât never show it ter
me.â

âHe carries one now,â remarked the little boy with something like a
triumphant look on his face.

âTooby shoâ,â said Uncle Remus; âtooby shoâ he do. He start ter totinâ
one when he tuck anâ tuck a notion fer ter go a-courtinâ. It had his name
in one cornder, anâ he useter sprinkle it wid stuff outân a pepper-sauce
bottle. It shoâ wuz rank, dat stuff wuz; it smell so sweet it make you
fergit whar you live at. I take notice dat you ainât got none on yone.â

âNo; mother says that cologne or any kind of perfumery on your
handkerchief makes you common.â

Uncle Remus leaned his head back, closed his eyes, and permitted a
heartrending groan to issue from his lips. The little boy showed enough
anxiety to ask him what the matter was. âNothinâ much, honey; I wuz des
tryinâ fer ter count how many diffunt kinder people dey is in dis big
worlâ, anâ âfoâ I got moâ dan half done wid my countinâ, a pain struck me
in my mizry, anâ I had ter break off.â

âI know what you mean,â said the child. âYou think mother is queer;
grandmother thinks so too.â

âHow come you ter be so wise, honey?â Uncle Remus inquired, opening his
eyes wide with astonishment.

âI know by the way you talk, and by the way grandmother looks sometimes,â
answered the little boy.

Uncle Remus said nothing for some time. When he did speak, it was to
lead the little boy to believe that he had been all the time engaged in
thinking about something else. âTalkinâ er dirty folks,â he said, âyou
oughter seed yoâ pa when he wuz a little bit er chap. Dey wuz long days
when you couldnât tell ef he wuz black er white, he wuz dat dirty. Heâd
come outân de big house in de morninâ ez clean ez a new pin, anâ âfoâ ten
er-clock you couldnât tell what kinder clof his cloze wuz made outân.
Manyâs de day when Iâve seed olâ Miss--datâs yoâ great-granâmammy--comb
ânuff trash outân his head fer ter fill a basket.â

The little boy laughed at the picture that Uncle Remus drew of his
father. âHeâs very clean now,â said the lad loyally.

âMaybe he is anâ maybe he ainât,â remarked Uncle Remus, suggesting a
doubt. âDatâs needer here ner dar. Is he any better off clean dan what he
wuz when you couldnât put yoâ hanâs on âim widout havinâ ter go anâ wash
um? Yoâ granâmammy useter call âim a pig, anâ clean ez he may be now, I
take notice dat he makes moâ complaint er headache anâ de heartburn dan
what he done when he wuz runninâ rounâ here half-naked anâ full er mud. I
hear tell dat some nights he canât git no sleep, but when he wuz little
like you--no, suh, Iâll not say dat, bekaze he wuz bigger dan what you
is fum de time he kin toddle rounâ widout nobody heâpinâ him; but when
he wuz olâ ez you anâ twice ez big, dey ainât narry night dat he canât
sleep--anâ not only all night, but half de day ef deyâd âaâ let âim. Dey
ought ter let you run rounâ here like he done, anâ git dirty. Dey ainât
nothinâ moâ wholesomer dan a peck er two er clean dirt on a little chap
like you.â

There is no telling what comment the child would have made on this
sincere tribute to clean dirt, for his attention was suddenly attracted
to something that was gradually taking shape in the hands of Uncle Remus.
At first it seemed to be hardly worthy of notice, for it had been only a
thin piece of board. But now the one piece had become four pieces, two
long and two short, and under the deft manipulations of Uncle Remus it
soon assumed a boxlike shape.

The old man had reached the point of his work where silence was necessary
to enable him to do it full justice. As he fitted the thin boards
together, a whistling sound issued from his lips, as though he were
letting off steam; but the singular noise was due to the fact that he
was completely absorbed in his work. He continued to fit and trim, and
trim and fit, until finally the little boy could no longer restrain his
curiosity. âUncle Remus, what are you making?â he asked plaintively.

âLarroes fer ter kech meddlers,â was the prompt and blunt reply.

âWell, what are larroes to catch meddlers?â the child insisted.

âNothinâ much anâ sumpân moâ. Dicky, Dicky, killt a chicky, anâ fried it
quicky, in de oven, like a sloven. Den ter his daddyâs Sunday hat, he
tuck ânâ hitched de olâ black cat. Now what you reckon make him do dat?
Ef you canât tell me word fer word anâ spellinâ fer spellinâ weâll go out
anâ come in anâ take a walk.â

He rose, grunting as he did so, thus paying an unintentional tribute to
the efficacy of age as the partner of rheumatic aches and stiff joints.
âYou hear me gruntinâ,â he remarked--âwell, datâs bekaze I ainât de
chicky fried by Dicky, which he eât ânuff fer ter make âim sicky.â As he
went out the child took his hand, and went trotting along by his side,
thus affording an interesting study for those who concern themselves with
the extremes of life. Hand in hand the two went out into the fields, and
thence into the great woods, where Uncle Remus, after searching about for
some time, carefully deposited his oblong box, remarking: âEf I donât
make no mistakes, dis ainât so mighty fur fum de place whar de creeturs
has der playgrounâ, anâ dey ainât no tellinâ but what one un umâll creep
in dar when deyer playinâ hidinâ, anâ ef he do, heâll shoâ be our meat.â

âOh, itâs a trap!â exclaimed the little boy, his face lighting up with
enthusiasm.

âAnâ dey waânât nobody here fer ter tell you!â Uncle Remus declared,
astonishment in his tone. âWell, ef dat donât bang my time, I ainât no
free nigger. Now, ef dat had âaâ been yoâ pa at de same age, Iâd âaâ had
ter tel âim forty-levâm times, anâ den he wouldnât âaâ bâlieved me twel
he see sumpâin in dar tryinâ fer ter git out. Den heâd say it wuz a trap,
but not befoâ. I ainât blaminâ âim,â Uncle Remus went on, âkaze âtainât
eveây chap dat kin tell a trap time he see it, anâ moâ dan dat, traps
donâ allers ketch what dey er sot fer.â

He paused, looked all around, and up in the sky, where fleecy clouds
were floating lazily along, and in the tops of the trees, where the
foliage was swaying gently in the breeze. Then he looked at the little
boy. âEf I ainât gone anâ got losâ,â he said, âainât so mighty fur fum de
place whar Mr. Man, once âpon a time--not yoâ time ner yit my time, but
some time--tuck ânâ sot a trap fer Brer Rabbit. In dem days, dey hadnât
lâarnt how to be kyarpenters, anâ dish yer trap what Iâm tellinâ you
âbout wuz a great big contraption. Big ez Brer Rabbit wuz, it wuz lots
too big fer him.

âNow, whiles Mr. Man wuz fixinâ up dis trap, Mr. Rabbit waânât so mighty
fur off. He hear de saw--er-rash! er-rash!--anâ he hear de hammer--bang,
bang, bang!--anâ he ax hisseâf what all dis racket wuz âbout. He see Mr.
Man come outân his yard totinâ sumpân, anâ he got furder off; he see Mr.
Man cominâ todes de bushes, anâ he tuck ter de woods; he see âim cominâ
todes de woods, anâ he tuck ter de bushes. Mr. Man tote de trap so fur
anâ no furder. He put it down, he did, anâ Brer Rabbit watch âim; he put
in de bait, anâ Brer Rabbit watch âim; he fix de trigger, anâ still Brer
Rabbit watch âim. Mr. Man look at de trap anâ it satchify him. He look at
it anâ laugh, anâ when he do dat, Brer Rabbit wunk one eye, anâ wiggle
his mustache, anâ chaw his cud.

âAnâ dat ainât all he do, needer. He sot out in de bushes, he did, anâ
study how ter git some game in de trap. He study so hard, anâ he got so
errytated, dat he thumped his behime foot on de grounâ twel it sounâ
like a cow dancinâ out dar in de bushes, but âtwant no cow, ner yit no
calf--âtwuz des Brer Rabbit studyinâ. Atter so long a time, he put out
down de road todes dat part er de country whar mosâ er de creeturs live
at. Eveây time he hear a fuss, heâd dodge in de bushes, kaze he wanter
see who cominâ. He keep on anâ he keep on, anâ bimeby he hear olâ Brer
Wolf trottinâ down de road.

âIt so happen dat Brer Wolf wuz de veây one what Brer Rabbit wanter
see. Dey was perlite ter one anâer, but dey waânât no frienâly feelinâ
âtwixt um. Well, here come olâ Brer Wolf, hongrier dan a chicken-hawk on
a frosty morninâ, anâ ez he come up he see Brer Rabbit settinâ by de side
er de road lookinâ like he done losâ all his fambly anâ his friends ter
boot.

âDey pass de time er day, anâ den Brer Wolf kinder grin anâ say,
âLaws-a-massy, Brer Rabbit, what ail you? You look like you done had
a spell er fever anâ ague; what de trouble?â âTrouble, Brer Wolf? You
ainât never see no trouble twel you git whar Iâm at. Maybe you wouldnât
minâ it like I does, kaze I ainât usen ter it. But I bounâ you done seed
me light-minded fer de lasâ time. Iâm done--Iâm plum woâ out,â sez Brer
Rabbit, sezee. Dis make Brer Wolf open his eyes wide. He say, âDis de
fus time I ever is hear you talk dat a-way, Brer Rabbit; take yoâ time
anâ tell me âbout it. I ainât had my brekkus yit, but dat donât make no
diffunce, long ez youer in trouble. Iâll heâp you out ef I kin, anâ moâ
dan dat, Iâll put some heart in de work.â When he say dis, he grin anâ
show his tushes, anâ Brer Rabbit kinder edge âway fum âim. He say, âTell
me de trouble, Brer Rabbit, anâ Iâll do my level besâ fer ter heâp you
out.â

âWid dat, Brer Rabbit âlow dat Mr. Man done been hire him fer ter take
keer er his truck patch, anâ keep out de minks, de mush-rats, anâ de
weasels. He say dat he done so well settinâ up night atter night, when
he des might ez well been in bed, dat Mr. Man prommus âim sumpân extry
âsides de mess er greens what he gun âim eveây day. Atter so long a time,
he say, Mr. Man âlow dat he gwineter make âim a present uv a cradle so he
kin rock de little Rabs ter sleep when dey cry. So said, so done, he say.
Mr. Man make de cradle anâ tell Brer Rabbit he kin take it home widâ im.
He start out wid it, he say, but it got so heavy he hatter set it down in
de woods, anâ datâs de reason why Brer Wolf seed âim settinâ down by de
side er de road, lookinâ like he in deep trouble. Brer Wolf sot down, he
did, anâ study, anâ bimeby he say heâd like mighty well fer ter have a
cradle fer his chillun, long ez cradles wuz de style. Brer Rabbit say dey
been de style fer de longest, anâ ez fer Brer Wolf wantinâ one, he say he
kin have de one what Mr. Man make fer him, kaze itâs lots too big fer his
chillun. âYou know how folks is,â sez Brer Rabbit, sezee. âDey try ter do
what dey dunner how ter do, anâ darâs der house bigger dan a barn, anâ
darâs de fence wid moâ holes in it dan what dey is in a saine, anâ kaze
dey have great big chillun dey got de idee dat eveây cradle what dey make
musâ fit der own chillun. Anâ datâs how come I canât tote de cradle what
Mr. Man make fer me moâ dan ten steps at a time.â

âBrer Wolf ax Brer Rabbit what he gwineter do fer a cradle, anâ Brer
Rabbit âlow he kin manage fer ter git long wid de olâ one twel he kin

BROTHER RABBIT AND BROTHER BULL-FROG


The day that the little boy got permission to go to mill with Uncle
Remus was to be long remembered. It was a bran new experience to the
city-bred child, and he enjoyed it to the utmost. It is true that Uncle
Remus didnât go to mill in the old-fashioned way, but even if the little
chap had known of the old-fashioned way, his enjoyment would not have
been less. Instead of throwing a bag of corn on the back of a horse, and
perching himself on top in an uneasy and a precarious position, Uncle
Remus placed the corn in a spring wagon, helped the little boy to climb
into the seat, clucked to the horse, and went along as smoothly and as
rapidly as though they were going to town.

Everything was new to the lad--the road, the scenery, the mill, and
the big mill-pond, and, best of all, Uncle Remus allowed him to enjoy
himself in his own way when they came to the end of their journey. He was
such a cautious and timid child, having little or none of the spirit of
adventure that is supposed to dominate the young, that the old negro was
sure he would come to no harm. Instead of wandering about, and going to
places where he had no business to go, the little boy sat where he could
see the water flowing over the big dam. He had never seen such a sight
before, and the water seemed to him to have a personality of its own--a
personality with both purpose and feeling.

The river was not a very large one, but it was large enough to be
impressive when its waters fell and tumbled over the big dam. The little
boy watched the tumbling water as it fell over the dam and tossed itself
into foam on the rocks below; he watched it so long, and he sat so still
that he was able to see things that a noisier youngster would have missed
altogether. He saw a big bull-frog creep warily from the water, and wipe
his mouth and eyes with one of his fore legs and he saw the same frog
edge himself softly toward a white butterfly that was flitting about
near the edge of the stream. He saw the frog lean forward, and then the
butterfly vanished. It seemed like a piece of magic. The child knew that
the frog had caught the butterfly, but how? The fluttering insect was
more than a foot from the frog when it disappeared, and he was sure that
the frog had neither jumped nor snapped at the butterfly. What he saw, he
saw as plainly as you can see your hand in the light of day.

And he saw another sight too that is not given to every one to see.
While he was watching the tumbling water, and wondering where it all
came from and where it was going, he thought he saw swift-moving shadows
flitting from the water below up and into the mill-pond above. He never
would have been able to discover just what the shadows were if one of
them had not paused a moment while half-way to the top of the falling
water. It poised itself for one brief instant, as a humming-bird poises
over a flower, but during that fraction of time the little boy was able
to see that what he thought was a shadow was really a fish going from the
water below to the mill-pond above. The child could hardly believe his
eyes, and for a little while it seemed that the whole world was turned
topsy-turvy, especially as the shadows continued to flit from the water
below to the mill-pond above.

And he was still more puzzled when he reported the strange fact to Uncle
Remus, for the old negro took the information as a matter of course.
With him the phenomenon was almost as old as his experience. The only
explanation that he could give of it was that the fish--or some kinds of
fish, and he didnât know rightly what kind it was--had a habit of falling
from the bottom of the falls to the top. The most that he knew was that
it was a fact, and that it was occurring every day in the year when the
fish were running. It was certainly wonderful, as in fact everything
would be wonderful if it were not so familiar.

âWe ainât got but one way er lookinâ at things,â remarked Uncle Remus,
âanâ ef youâll bâlieve me, honey, itâs a mighty one-sided way. Ef you
could git on a perch someârs anâ see things like dey reely is, anâ not
like dey seem ter us, I be bounâ youâd holâ yoâ breff anâ shet yoâ eyes.â

The old man, without intending it, was going too deep into a deep subject
for the child to follow him, and so the latter told him about the
bull-frog and the butterfly. The statement seemed to call up pleasing
reminiscences, for Uncle Remus laughed in a very hearty way. And when
his laughing had subsided, he continued to chuckle until the little boy
wondered what the source of his amusement could be. Finally he asked the
old negro point blank what had caused him to laugh at such a rate.

âYoâ pa would âaâ knowâd,â Uncle Remus replied, and then he grew solemn
again and sighed heavily. For a little while he seemed to be listening to
the clatter of the mill, but, finally, he turned to the little boy. âAnâ
so you done made de âquaintance er olâ Brer Bull-Frog? Is you take notice
whedder he had a tail er no?â

âWhy, of course he didnât have a tail!â exclaimed the child. âNeither
toad-frogs nor bull-frogs have tails. I thought everybody knew that.â

âOh, well, ef dat de way you feel âbout um, âtainât no use fer ter pester
wid um. It done got so now dat folks donât bâlieve nothinâ but what dey
kin see, anâ moâ dan half un um wonât bâlieve what dey see less ân dey
kin feel un it too. But dat ainât de way wid dem whatâs olâ ânough fer
ter know. Ef Iâd âaâ tolâ you âbout de fishes swimminâ agâin fallinâ
water, you wouldnât âaâ bâlieved me, would you? No, you wouldnât--anâ
yit, dar âtwuz right âfoâ yoâ face anâ eyes. Dar dey wuz a-skeetinâ fum
de bottom er de dam right up in de mill-ponâ, anâ you settinâ dar lookinâ
at um. Sâposinâ you wuz ter say dat you wonât bâlieve um lessân you kin
feel um; does you speck de fish gwineter hang dar in de fallinâ water anâ
wait twel you kin wade âcross de slippây rocks anâ put yoâ hanâ on um?
Did you look right close fer ter see ef de bull-frog what you seed is got
a tail er no?â

The little boy admitted that he had not. He knew as well as anybody that
no kind of a frog has a tail, unless it is the Texas frog, which is only
a horned lizard, for he saw one once in Atlanta, and it was nothing but a
rusty-back lizard with a horn on his head.

âI ainât âsputinâ what you say, honey,â said Uncle Remus, âbut de creetur
what you seed mought âaâ been a frog anâ you not know it. One thing I
does know is dat in times gone by de bull-frog had a tail, kaze I hear de
olâ folks sesso, anâ moâ dan dat, dey knowâd des how he losâ it--de whar,
anâ de when, anâ de which-away. Fer all I know it wuz right here at dish
yer identual mill-ponâ. I ainât gwine inter court anâ make no affledave
on it, but ef anybody wuz ter walk up anâ pâint der finger at me, anâ say
dat dis is de place whar olâ Brer Bull-Frog lose his tail, Iâd up anâ
âlow, âYasser, it musâ be de place, kaze it look mightâly like de place
what I been hear tell âbout.â Anâ den Iâd shet my eyes anâ see ef I canât
git it straight in my dream.â

Uncle Remus paused, and pretended to be counting a handful of red grains
of corn that he had found somewhere in the mill. Seeing that he showed no
disposition to tell how Brother Bull-Frog had lost his tail, the little
boy reminded him of it. But the old man laughed. âEf Brer Bull-Frog ainât
never had no tail,â he said, âhow de name er goodness he gwineter lose
um? Ef he yever is had a tail, why den datâs a gray hoss uv anâer color.
Deyâs a tale âbout âim havinâ a tail anâ losinâ it, but how kin dey be a
tale when dey ainât no tail?â

Well, the little boy didnât know at all, and he looked so disconsolate
and so confused that the old negro relented. âNow, den,â he remarked,
âef olâ Brer Bull-Frog had a tail anâ he ainât got none now, dey must
âaâ been sumpân happen. In dem times--de times what all deze tales tells
you âbout--Brer Bull-Frog stayed in anâ arounâ still water des like he
do now. De bad colâ dat he had in dem days, heâs got it yit--de same
pop-eyes, anâ de same balâ head. Den, ez now, dey waânât a bunch er haâr
on it dat you could pull out wid a paâr er tweezers. Ez he bellers now,
des dat a-way he bellered den, moâ speshually at night. Anâ talk âbout
settinâ up late--why, olâ Brer Bull-Frog could beat dem what fust got in
de habits er settinâ up late.

[Illustration: â_De yuther creeturs canât git no sleep_â ]

âDeyâs one thing dat youâll hatter giâ âim credit fer, anâ dat wuz
keepinâ his face anâ hanâs clean, anâ in takinâ keer er his cloze.
Nobody, not even his mammy, had ter patch his britches er tack buttons on
his coat. See âim whar you may anâ when you mought, he wuz allers lookinâ
spick anâ span des like he done come right outân a banâ-box. You know
what de riddle say âbout âim; when he stanâ up he sets down, anâ when he

he bleeze ter be âshameâ er hollerinâ so much, heâd up anâ holler agâin.
It got so dat de creeturs hatter go âway off someârs ef dey wanter git

Bull-Frog would wake um up time dey git ter dozinâ good.

Brer Bull-Frog, he laugh like a bull in de pasturâ, anâ Brer Rabbit giâ a
sidelong look dat oughter tolâ âim ez much ez a map kin tell one er deze
yer school scholars. Brer Rabbit look at âim, but he ainât say narry a
word. He des shuck hisseâf once moâ, anâ put out fer home whar he kin set
in front er de fire anâ git dry.

âAtter dat day, Brer Rabbit riz mighty soon anâ went ter bed late, anâ
he watch Brer Bull-Frog so close dat dey waânât nothinâ he kin do but
what Brer Rabbit know âbout it time it âuz done; anâ one thing he knowâd
better dan all--he knowâd dat when de winter time come Brer Bull-Frog
would have ter pack up his duds anâ move over in de bog whar de water
donât git friz up. Dat much he knowâd, anâ when dat time come, he laid
off fer ter make Brer Bull-Frogâs journey, short ez it wuz, ez full er
hapâninâs ez de day when de olâ cow went dry. He tuck anâ move his bed
anâ board ter de big holler poplar, not fur fum de mill-ponâ, anâ dar he
stayed anâ keep one eye on Brer Bull-Frog bofe night anâ day. He ainât
lose no flesh whiles he waitinâ, kaze he ainât one er deze yer kinâ what
mopes anâ gits sollumcolly; he wuz all de time betwixt a grin anâ a
giggle.

âHe knowâd mighty well--none better--dat time goes by turns in deze low
grounâs, anâ he wait fer de day when Brer Bull-Frog gwineter move his
belonginâs fum ponâ ter bog. Anâ bimeby dat time come, anâ when it come,
Brer Bull-Frog is done fergit offân his mind all âbout Brer Rabbit anâ
his splashification. He rig hisseâf out in his Sunday best, anâ he look
kerscrumptious ter dem what like dat kinder doinâs. He had on a little
sojer hat wid green anâ white speckles all over it, anâ a long green
coat, anâ satin britches, anâ a white silk wescut, anâ shoes wid silver
buckles. Moâ dan dat, he had a green umbrell, fer ter keep fum havinâ
freckles, anâ his long spotted tail wuz done up in de umbrell kivver so
dat it wonât drag on de grounâ.â

Uncle Remus paused to see what the little boy would say to this last
statement, but the childâs training prevented the asking of many
questions, and so he only laughed at the idea of a frog with a tail, and
the tail done up in the cover of a green umbrella. The laughter of the
youngster was hearty enough to satisfy the old negro, and he went on with
the story.

âWhiles all dis gwine on, honey, you better bâlieve dat Brer Rabbit
waânât so mighty fur fum dar. When Brer Bull-Frog come out anâ start
fer ter promenade ter de bog, Brer Rabbit show hisseâf anâ make like he
skeered. He broke anâ run, anâ den he stop fer ter see what âtis--anâ den
he run a leetle ways anâ stop agâin, anâ he keep on dodginâ anâ runninâ
twel he fool Brer Bull-Frog inter bâlievinâ dat he wuz skeerâd mighty
nigh ter death.

âYou know how folks does when dey git de idee dat somebodyâs âfearâd un
um--ef you donât youâll finâ out long âfoâ yoâ whiskers gits ter hanginâ
to yoâ knees. When folks take up dis idee, dey gits biggity, anâ dey
ainât no stayinâ in de same country wid um.

[Illustration: â_He shuck his umbrellâ like he mad_â]

âWell, Brer Bull-Frog, he git de idee dat Brer Rabbit wuz âfearâd un âim,
anâ he shuck his umbrell like he mad, anâ he beller: âWhar my gun?â Brer
Rabbit flung up bofe hanâs like he wuz skeerâd er gittinâ a load er shot
in his vitals, anâ den he broke anâ run ez hard ez he kin. Brer Bull-Frog
holler out, âCome yer, you vilyun, anâ leâ me giâ you de frailinâ what
I done promise you!â but olâ Brer Rabbit, he keep on a-gwine. Brer
Bull-Frog went hoppinâ atter, but he ainât make much headway, kaze all de
time he wuz hoppinâ he wuz tryinâ to strut.

ââTwuz eâen about ez much ez Brer Rabbit kin do fer ter keep fum
laughinâ, but he led Brer Bull-Frog ter de holler poplar, whar he had
his hatchet hid. Ez he went in, he âlow, âYou canât git me!â He went in,
he did, anâ out he popped on tâer side. By dat time Brer Bull-Frog wuz
mighty certain anâ sho dat Brer Rabbit wuz skeerâd ez he kin be, anâ
inter de holler he went, widout so much ez takinâ de trouble ter shet up
his umbrell. When he got in de holler, in coâse he ainât see hide ner
haâr er Brer Rabbit, anâ he beller out, âWhar is you? You may hide, but
Iâll finâ you, anâ when I does--when I does!â He ainât say all he wanter
say, kaze by dat time Brer Rabbit wuz lamminâ on de tree wid his hatchet.
He hit it some mighty heavy whacks, anâ Brer Bull-Frog git de idee dat
somebody wuz cuttinâ it down.

[Illustration: â_Brer Rabbit run rounâ ter whar he wuz anâ chop his tail
off_â]

âDis kinder skeerâd âim, kaze he know dat ef de tree fell while he in de
holler, itâd be all-night Isom wid him. But when he make a move fer ter
turn rounâ in dar fer ter come out, Brer Rabbit run rounâ ter whar he
wuz, anâ chop his tail off right smick-smack-smoove.â

The veteran story-teller paused, and looked at the clouds that were
gathering in the sky. ââTwouldnât âstonish me none,â he remarked dryly,
âef we wuz ter have some fallinâ wedder.â

âBut, Uncle Remus, what happened when Brother Rabbit cut off the
Bull-Frogâs tail?â inquired the little boy.

The old man sighed heavily, and looked around, as if he were hunting for
some way of escape. âWhy, honey, when de Frog tail wuz cut off, it stayed
off, but dey tells me dat it kepâ on a wigglinâ plum twel de sun went
down. Dis much I does know, dat sence dat day, none er de Frog fambly has
been troubled wid tails. Ef you donât believe me you kin ketch um anâ
see.â

WHY MR. DOG IS TAME


There were quite a number of dogs on the plantation--foxhounds, harriers,
a sheep dog, and two black-and-tan hounds that had been trained to tree
coons and âpossums. In these, the little boy took an abiding interest,
and he soon came to know the name and history of each individual dog.
There was Jonah, son of Hodo, leader of the foxhounds, Jewel, leader of
the harriers, and Walter, the sheep dog, who drove up the cows and hogs
every evening. Indeed, it was not long before the little boy knew as much
about the dogs as Uncle Remus did.

He imagined he knew more, for one day he informed the old man that once
upon a time all dogs were wild, and roamed about the woods and fields
just as the wild animals do now.

âYou see me settinâ here,â Uncle Remus remarked; âwell, suh, olâ ez I
is, Iâd like mighty well ter finâ out how you come ter know âbout deze
happeninâs way back yander.â

The little boy made no secret of the matter; he answered with pride that
his mother had been reading to him out of a great big book with pictures
in it. Uncle Remus stretched his arms above his head, and opened wide his
eyes. Astonishment took possession of his countenance. The child laughed
with delight when he saw the amazement of Uncle Remus. âYes,â he went on,
âmother read about all the wild animals. The book said that when the dogs
were wild they used to go in droves, just as the wolves do now.â

âYasser, datâs so!â exclaimed Uncle Remus with admiration, âanâ ef
you keep on like you gwine, âtwonât be long âfoâ youâll know lotâs
moâ âbout de creeturs dan what I does--lotâs moâ.â Then he became
confidential--âWuz dey anything in de big book, honey, âbout de time dat
de Dog start in fer ter live wid Mr. Man?â The little boy shook his head.
If there was anything about it in the big book from which his mother had
been reading, she had kept it to herself.

âWell, Iâm mighty glad dey ainât nothinâ in dar âbout it, kaze ef dey had
âaâ been, Iâd âaâ been bleeze ter giâ up my job, kaze when dey gits ter
puttinâ tales in a book, datâs a sign.â

âA sign of what, Uncle Remus?â

âDes a sign, honey--a plain sign. Ef you dunner what a sign is, Iâll
never tell you.â

âWhen did the Dog begin to live with Mr. Man?â the little boy inquired.
âOnce he was wild, and now he is tame. How did he become tame?â

âAh-yi! den you got de idee dat olâ man Remus know sumpân nâer what ainât
down in de books?â

âWhy, you asked me if there was anything in the big book that told about
the time when the Dog went to live with Mr. Man,â the little boy replied.

âDatâs what I done,â exclaimed Uncle Remus with a laugh. âAnâ I done it
kaze I laid off ter tel you âbout it one er deze odd-come-shorts when de
moon ridinâ high, anâ de winâ playinâ a chune in de big pine.â

âWhy not tell it now?â the little boy asked.

âLeâ me see, is I well er is I sick? Is I full er is I hongry? Ef I done
fergot what I had fer dinner day âfoâ yistiddy, den âtainât no use fer
ter try ter tell a tale âbout olâ times. Wuz it cake? No, âtwant cake.
Wuz it chicken-pie? No, âtwant chicken-pie. What, den? Ah-h-h! Now I
knows: âTwuz tater custard, anâ it seem like I kin tasâe it yit. Yasser!
Day âfoâ yistiddy wuz so long ago dat it look like a dream.â

âIt wasnât any dream,â the little boy declared. âMother wouldnât let me
have any at the house, and when grandmother sent your dinner, she put two
pieces of potato custard on a plate, and you said that one of them was
for me.â

âAnâ you eât it,â Uncle Remus declared; âyou eât it, anâ you liked it so
well dat you sot yoâ eye on my piece, anâ ef I hadnât âaâ grabbed it, I
bounâ I wouldnât âaâ had no tater custard.â

The little boy laughed and blushed. âHow did you know I wanted the other
piece?â he asked.

âI know it by my nose anâ my two big toes,â Uncle Remus replied. âPut a
boy in smellinâ distance uv a piece er tater custard, anâ it seem like de
custard will fly up anâ hit him in de mouf, no matter how much he try ter
dodge.â

Uncle Remus paused and pulled a raveling from his shirt-sleeve, looking
at the little boy meanwhile.

âI know very well you havenât forgotten the story,â remarked the child,
âfor grandmother says you never forgot anything, especially the old-time
tales.â

âWell, suh, I speck she knows. She been knowinâ me evâry sence she wuz a
baby gal, anâ moâ dan dat, she know right pâint blank what Iâm a-thinkinâ
âbout when she kin git her eye on me.â

âAnd she says she never caught you tellinâ a fib.â

âIs she say dat?â Uncle Remus inquired with a broad grin. âEf she did,
Iâm lots sharper dan I looks ter be, kaze many and manyâs de time when I
been skeerâd white, thinkinâ she done cotch me. Tooby shoâ, tooby shoâ!â

âBut what about the Dog, Uncle Remus?â

âWhat dog, honey? Oh, youâll hatter scuzen me--Iâm lots older dan what I
looks ter be. You mean de Dog what tuck up at Mr. Manâs house. Well, olâ
Brer Dog wuz eâen about like he is deze days, scratchinâ fer fleas, anâ
growlinâ over his vittles stidder sayinâ grace, anâ berryinâ de bones
when he had one too many. He wuz des like he is now, âceppinâ dat he wuz
wilâ. He galloped wid Brer Fox, anâ loped wid Brer Wolf, anâ cantered wid
Brer Coon. He went all de gaits, anâ he had dez ez good a time ez any un
um, anâ des ez bad a time.

âNow, one day, someârs âtwixâ Monday morninâ anâ Saddy night, he wuz
settinâ in de shade scratchinâ hisseâf, anâ he wuz tooken wid a spell er
thinkinâ. Heâd des come thoo a mighty hard winter wid de yuther creeturs,
anâ he up anâ say ter hisseâf dat ef he had ter do like dat one moâ
season, itâd be de enâ er him anâ his fambly. You could count his ribs,
anâ his hip-bones stuck out like de horns on a hat-rack.

âWhiles he wuz settinâ dar, scratchinâ anâ studyinâ, anâ studyinâ anâ
scratchinâ, who should come meanderinâ down de big road but olâ Brer
Wolf; anâ it âuz âHello, Brer Dog! you look like you ainât seed de inside
uv a smokehouse fer quite a whet. I ainât sayinâ dat I got much fer ter
brag on, kaze I ainât in no better fix dan what you is. De colder it
gits, de skacer de vittles grows.â Anâ den he ax Brer Dog whar he gwine
anâ how soon he gwineter git dar. Brer Dog make answer dat it donât make
no diffunce whar he go ef he donât finâ dinner ready.

âBrer Wolf âlow dat de way ter git dinner is ter make a fier, kaze
âtainât no use fer ter try ter eat ef dey donât do dat. Ef dey donât git
nothinâ fer ter cook, deyâll have a place whar dey kin keep warm. Brer
Dog say he see whar Brer Wolf is dead right, but whar dey gwine git a
fier? Brer Wolf say de quickest way is ter borry a chunk fum Mr. Man er
his olâ âoman. But when it come ter sayinâ who gwine atter it, dey bofe
kinder hung back, kaze dey knowâd dat Mr. Man had a walkinâ-cane what he
kin pâint at anybody anâ snap a cap on it anâ blow de light right out.

âBut bimeby, Brer Dog sayâll go atter de chunk er fier, anâ he ainât no
moâ dan say dat, âfoâ off he put, anâ he travel so peart, dat âtwant long
âfoâ he come ter Mr. Manâs house. When he got ter de gate he sot down anâ
done some moâ studyinâ, anâ ef de gate had âaâ been shot, heâd âaâ turned
right rounâ anâ went back like he come; but some er de chillun had been
playinâ out in de yard, anâ dey lefâ de gate open, an so dar âtwuz. Study
ez he mought, he canât finâ no skuce fer gwine back widout de chunk er
fier. Anâ in he went.

âWell, talk âbout folks beinâ âumble; you ainât seed no
âumble-come-tumble twel you see Brer Dog when he went in dat gate.
He ainât take time fer ter look rounâ, he so skeerâd. He hear hogs
a-gruntinâ anâ pigs a-squealinâ, he hear hens a-cacklinâ anâ roosters
crowinâ, but he ainât turn his head. He had sense ânuff not ter go in de
house by de front way. He went rounâ de back way whar de kitchen wuz, anâ
when he got dar he âfraid ter go any furder. He went ter de doâ, he did,
anâ he âfraid ter knock. He hear chillun laughinâ anâ playinâ in dar, anâ
fer de fust time in all his born days, he âgun ter feel lonesome.

âBimeby, some un open de doâ anâ den shot it right quick. But Brer Dog
ainât see nobody; he âuz too âumble-come-tumble fer dat. He wuz lookinâ
at de grounâ, anâ wonderinâ what âuz gwineter happen nexâ. It must âaâ
been one er de chillun what open de doâ, kaze âtwant long âfoâ here come
Mr. Man wid de walkinâ-cane what had fier in it. He come ter de doâ, he
did, anâ he say, âWhat you want here?â Brer Dog wuz too skeerâd fer ter
talk; all he kin do is ter des wag his tail. Mr. Man, he âlow, âYou in de
wrong house, anâ you better go on whar you got some business.â

âBrer Dog, he crouch down close ter de grounâ, anâ wag his tail. Mr.
Man, he look at âim, anâ he ainât know whedder fer ter turn loose his
gun er not, but his olâ âoman, she hear him talkinâ, anâ she come ter de
doâ, anâ see Brer Dog crouchinâ dar, âumbler dan deâ âumblest, anâ she
say, âPoâ feller! you ainât gwine ter hurt nobody, is you?â anâ Brer Dog
âlow, âNo, maâam, I ainât; I des come fer ter borry a chunk er fier.â
Anâ she say, âWhat in de name er goodness does you want wid fier? Is you
gwine ter burn us outân house anâ home?â Brer Dog âlow, âNo, maâam! dat I
ainât; I des wanter git warm.â Den de âoman say, âI clean fergot âbout de
colâ wedder--come in de kitchen here anâ warm yoâseâf much ez you wanter.â

âDat wuz mighty good news fer Brer Dog, anâ in he went. Dey wuz a nice
big fier on de hâath, anâ de chillun wuz settinâ all rounâ eatinâ der
dinner. Dey make room fer Brer Dog, anâ down he sot in a warm cornder,
anâ âtwant long âfoâ he wuz feelinâ right splimmy-splammy. But he wuz
mighty hongry. He sot dar, he did, anâ watch de chillunâ eatinâ der
ashcake anâ buttermilk, anâ his eyeballs âud foller eveây mouffle dey
eât. De âoman, she notice dis, anâ she went ter de cubberd anâ got a
piece er warm ashcake, anâ put it down on de hâath.

âBrer Dog ainât need no seconâ invite--he des gobble up de ashcake âfoâ
you kin say Jack Robberson wid yoâ mouf shot. He ainât had nigh nuff,
but he knowâd better dan ter show what his appetites wuz. He âgun ter
feel good, anâ den he got down on his hunkers, anâ lay his head down on
his foâpaws, anâ make like he gwine ter sleep. Atter âwhile, he smell
Brer Wolf, anâ he raise his head anâ look todes de doâ. Mr. Man he tuck
notice, anâ he say he bâlieve deyâs some un sneakinâ rounâ. Brer Dog
raise his head, anâ snuff todes de doâ, anâ growl ter hisseâf. So Mr.
Man tuck down his gun fum over de fireplace, anâ went out. De fust thing
he see when he git out in de yard wuz Brer Wolf runninâ out de gate, anâ
he up wid his gun--bang!--anâ he hear Brer Wolf holler. All he got wuz a
hanâful er haâr, but he come mighty nigh gittinâ de whole hide.

âWell, atter dat, Mr. Man finâ out dat Brer Dog could do âim a heap er
good, fusâ one way anâ den anâer. He could head de cows off when dey
make a break thoo de woods, he could take keer er de sheep, anâ he could
warn Mr. Man when some er de yuther creeturs wuz prowlinâ rounâ. Anâ den
he wuz some compâny when Mr. Man went huntinâ. He could trail de game,
anâ he could finâ his way home fum anywheres; anâ he could play wid de
chillun des like he wuz one un um.

ââTwant long âfoâ he got fat, anâ one day when he wuz amblinâ in de
woods, he meet up wid Brer Wolf. He howdied at âim, he did, but Brer Wolf
wonât skacely look at âim. Atter âwhile he say, âBrer Dog, why ânât you
come back dat day when you went atter fier?â Brer Dog pâint ter de collar
on his neck. He âlow, âYou see dis? Well, itâll tell you lots better dan
what I kin.â Brer Wolf say,âYou mighty fat. Why canât I come dar anâ do
like you does?â Brer Dog âlow, âDey ainât nothinâ fer ter hinder you.â

âSo de next morninâ, bright anâ early, Brer Wolf knock at Mr. Manâs
doâ. Mr. Man peep out anâ see who âtis, anâ tuck down his gun anâ went
out. Brer Wolf try ter be perlite, anâ he smile. But when he smile he
showâd all his tushes, anâ dis kinder skeer Mr. Man. He say, âWhat you
doinâ sneakinâ rounâ here?â Brer Wolf try ter be moâ perliter dan ever,
anâ he grin fum year ter year. Dis show all his tushes, anâ Mr. Man
lammed aloose at âim. Anâ dat âuz de lasâ time dat Brer Wolf ever try ter
live wid Mr. Man, an fum dat time on down ter dis day, it âuz war âtwix
Brer Wolf anâ Brer Dog.â

BROTHER RABBIT AND THE GIZZARD-EATER


âIt seem like ter me dat I hear somebody say, not longer dan day âfoâ
yistiddy, dat deyâd be mighty glad ef dey could finâ some un fer ter
bet wid um,â said Uncle Remus, staring hard at the little boy, and then
suddenly shutting his eyes tight, so that he might keep from laughing
at the expression he saw on the childâs face. Receiving no immediate
response to his remark, the old man opened his eyes again, and found the
little boy regarding him with a puzzled air.

âMy mother says it is wrong to bet,â said the child after awhile. He was
quite serious, and it was just this aspect of seriousness that made him
a little different from another little boy that had been raised at Uncle
Remusâs knee. âMother says that no Christian would want to bet.â

The old man closed his eyes again, as though trying to remember
something. He frowned and smacked his mouth before he spoke, âIt look
like dat I never is ter git de tasâe er dat chicken-pie what yoâ granâma
sont me outân my mouf. I dunner when I been had any chicken-pie what
stayed wid me like dat chicken-pie. But âbout dat bettinâ,â he remarked,
straightening himself in his chair, âI speck I musâ âaâ been a-dreaminâ.
I know mighty well it couldnât âaâ been you; so weâll des up anâ say
it wuz little Dreamus, anâ let it go at dat. All I know is dat dey wuz
a little chap lounginâ rounâ here tryinâ fer ter lâarn how ter play
mumbly-peg wid one er de case-knives what he tuck fum de white folksâ
dinner-table, anâ whiles he wuz in de middle er his lâarninâ, de olâ
speckled hen run fum under de house here, anâ sot up a mighty cacklinâ,
kaze she fearâd some un wuz gwineter interrupt de eggs what she been
nussinâ anâ warminâ up. She cackle, anâ she cackle, anâ den she cackle
some moâ fer ter keep fum fergittinâ how; anâ âlong âbout dat time, dish
yer little boy what I been tellinâ you âbout--I speck weâll be bleeze
ter call him Dreamus--he up wid a rock anâ flung it right at âer, anâ ef
sheâd âaâ been in de way er de rock, heâd âaâ come mighty nigh hittinâ
her. Dis make de olâ hen bofe skeerâd anâ fearâd anâ likewise mad, anâ
she hitched a squall on ter her cackle, anâ flop her wings. Seeinâ dat de
hen wuz mad, dis little chap, which he name Dreamus, he got mad, too, anâ
he âlowed, âI bet you I make you hush!â anâ dar dey had it, de olâ hen
runninâ anâ squallinâ, anâ de little chap zooninâ rocks at her. I speck
de hen would âaâ bet ef sheâd âaâ knowâd how--anâ she shoâ would âaâ won
de bet, kaze de lasâ news I hear fum âer she wuz runninâ anâ squallinâ.â

The little boy squirmed uneasily in his chair. He remembered the incident
very well, so well that he hardly knew what to say. But after a while,
thinking that it was both necessary and polite to say something, he
declared that when he made that remark to the hen he knew she wouldnât
understand him, and that what he said about betting was just a saying.

âDat mought be, honey,â said Uncle Remus, âbut donât you fool yoâseâf
âbout dat hen not knowinâ how ter talk, kaze dey has been times anâ
places when de creeturs kin do lots moâ talkinâ dan folks. When you git
ter be olâ ez what I is, youâll know dat talkinâ ainât got nothinâ in de
rounâ worlâ ter do wid fedders, anâ needer wid fur. I hear you say you
want ter bet wid de olâ hen, anâ ef you still wantinâ you got a mighty
good chance dis day ef de sun is mighty nigh down. Iâll bet you a thrip
agâin a ginger-cake dat when you had yoâ dinner you ainât finâ no chicken
gizzard in yoâ part er de pie.â

âNo,â replied the child, âI didnât, and when I asked grandmother about
it, she said she was going to raise some chickens next year with double
gizzards.â

âDid she say dat? Did Miss Sally say dat?â inquired Uncle Remus,
laughing delightedly. âWell, suh, dat shoâ do bang my time! How come she
ter know dat some er de creeturs got double gizzards? She shoâ is de
outdoinâest white âoman whatâs yever been bornded inter de worlâ. She
done sont me de chicken gizzard des so I kin tell you âbout de double
gizzards anâ de what-nots. Double gizzards! De veây name flings me âway
back yander ter olâ folks anâ olâ times. Laws-a-massy! I wonder what Miss
Sally gwine do nexâ; anybody what guess it oughter be president by good
rights.â Uncle Remus paused, and lowered his voice to a confidential
tone--âShe ainât tell you âbout de time when de Yallergater wuz honinâ
fer olâ Brer Rabbitâs double gizzards, is she, honey?â

âNo, she didnât tell me that, but she laughed, and when I asked her what
she was laughing at, she said Iâd find out by the time I was seven feet
tall.â

âYou hear dat, donât you?â Uncle Remus spoke as though there were a third
person in the room. âWhat I been tellinâ you all dis time?â and then he
laughed as though this third person were laughing with him. âYou may try,
anâ you may fly, but you never is ter see de beat er Miss Sally.â

âWas grandmother talking about a tale, Uncle Remus? It must have been a
very funny one, for she laughed until she had to take off her spectacles
and wipe them dry,â said the little boy.

âDatâs her! datâs Miss Sally up anâ down, anâ dey canât nobody git ahead
er her. She knowâd mighty well dat time you say sumpân âbout double
gizzards my minâ would fly right back ter de time when de Yalligater wuz
dribblinâ at de mouf, anâ olâ Brer Rabbit wuz shaking in his shoes.â

âIf itâs a long story, Iâm afraid you havenât time to tell it now,â
suggested the little boy.

The child was so polite that the old negro stood somewhat in awe of him,
and he was afraid, too, that it was ominous of some misfortune--there was
something uncanny about it from Uncle Remusâs point of view. âBless you,
honey! I got des ez much time ez what dey is--it all bâlongs ter me anâ
you. Maybe you wanter go someârs else; maybe youâll wait twel some yuther
day fer de platted whip dat I hear you talkinâ âbout.â

âNo; Iâll wait and get the story and the whip together--if you are not
too tired.â

The old negro looked at the little boy from the corner of his eye to
see if he was really in earnest. Satisfying himself on that score, he
promptly began to plait the whip while he unraveled the story. He seemed
to be more serious than usual, but one of the peculiarities of Uncle
Remus, as many a child had discovered, was that he was not to be judged
by any outward aspect. This is the way he began:

âEver since I been pirootinâ rounâ in deze low-grounâs, itâs been de talk
er dem what knowâd dat Brer Rabbit wuz a mighty man at a frolic. I donât
speck heâd show up much in deze days, but in de times when de creeturs
wuz bossinâ dey own jobs, Brer Rabbit wuz up fer perty nigh evâything dat
wuz gwine on ef dey want too much work in it. Dey couldnât be a dance er
a quiltinâ nowharâs arounâ but what heâd be dar; he wuz fust ter come anâ
last ter go.

[Illustration: â_He hollaâd fer de man what run de ferry_â]

âWell, dey wuz one time when he went too fur anâ stayed too late, bekaze
a big rain come endurinâ de time when dey wuz playinâ anâ dancinâ, anâ
when Brer Rabbit put out fer home, he founâ dat a big freshet done come
anâ gone. De dreens had got ter be creeks, de creeks had got ter be
rivers, anâ de rivers--well, I ainât gwine ter tell you what de rivers
wuz kaze youâd think dat I done tolâ de trufe good-bye. By makinâ big
jumps anâ gwine out er his way, Brer Rabbit manage fer ter git ez close
ter home ez de creek, but when he git dar, de creek wuz so wide dat it
make him feel like he been losâ so long dat his fambly done fergot him.
Many anâ many a time had he crossâ dat creek on a log, but de log done
gone, anâ de water wuz spread out all over creation. De water wuz wide,
but dat waânât moâ dan half--it look like it wuz de wettest water dat
Brer Rabbit ever lay eyes on.

[Illustration: â_Dar wuz olâ Brer Bâar settinâ at de foot er de tree_â]

âDey wuz a ferry dar fer times like dis, but it look like it wuz a
bigger fresh dan what dey had counted on. Brer Rabbit, he sot on de bank
anâ wipe de damp outân his face anâ eyes, anâ den he hollaâd fer de man
what run de ferry. He hollaâd anâ hollaâd, anâ bimeby, he hear some un
answer him, anâ he looked a little closer, anâ dar wuz de man, which his
name wuz Jerry, way up in de top limâs uv a tree; anâ he looked still
closer, anâ he seed dat Jerry had company, kaze dar wuz olâ Brer Bâar
settinâ at de foot er de tree, waitinâ fer Jerry fer ter come down so he
kin tell âim howdy.â Uncle Remus paused to see what effect this statement
would have on the little boy. The youngster said nothing, but his shrewd
smile showed the old man that he fully appreciated the reason why Jerry
was in no hurry to shake hands with Brother Bear.

âWell, suh, Brer Rabbit took notice dat dey wuz sumpân moâ dan dampness
âtwixâ um, an he start in ter holla again, anâ he hollaâd so loud, anâ he
hollaâd so long, dat he woke up olâ Brer Yalligater. Now, it ainât make
olâ Brer Yalligater feel good fer ter be wokened up at dat hour, kaze
heâd des had a nice supper er pine-knots anâ sweet âtaters, anâ he wuz
layinâ out at full lenk on his mud bed. He âlow ter hisseâf, he did, âWho
in de nation is dis tryinâ fer ter holla de bottom out er de creek?â He
lissen, anâ den he turn over anâ lissen agâin. He shot one eye, anâ den
he shot de yuther one, but dey ainât no sleepinâ in dat neighberhood.
Jerry in de tree, he holla back, âCanât come--got compâny!â

âBrer Yalligater, he hear dis, anâ he say ter hisseâf dat ef nobody
canât come, he kin, anâ he riz ter de top wid no moâ fuss dan a
fedder-bed makes when you let it âlone. He riz, he did, anâ his two eyes
look des perzackly like two bullets floatinâ on de water. He riz anâ
wunk his eye, anâ ax Brer Rabbit howdy, anâ moâ speshually how is his
daughter. Brer Rabbit, he say dat dey ainât no tellinâ how his daughter
is, kaze when he lefâ home her head wuz a-swellinâ. He say dat some er de
neighborsâ chillun come by anâ flung rocks at her anâ one un um hit her
on top er de head right whar de cow-lick is, anâ he hatter run atter de
doctor.

[Illustration: â_He riz anâ wunk his eye, anâ ax Brer Rabbit howdy_â]

âBrer Yalligater âlow, âYou donât tell me, Brer Rabbit, dat itâs come
ter dis! Yoâ chillun gittinâ chunked by yoâ neighborsâ chillun! Well,
well, well! I wish youâd tell me wharbouts itâs all a-gwine ter eenâ at.
Why, itâll git so atter while dat dey ainât no peace anywharâs âceppin at
my house in de bed er de creek.â

âBrer Rabbit say, âAinât it de trufe? Anâ not only does Brer Fox chillun
chunk my chillun on dey cow-licks, but no sooner is I gone atter de
doctor dan here come de creek a-risinâ. I may be wrong, but I ainât
skeerâd ter say dat it beats anything I yever is lay eyes on. Over yander
in de fur woods is what my daughter is layinâ wid de headache, anâ hereâs
her pa, anâ âtwixâ us is de bâilinâ creek. Ef I wuz ter try ter wade, ten
ter one de water would be over my head, anâ ef not dat bad, all de pills
what de doctor giâ me would melt in my pocket. Anâ dey might pizen me,
kaze de doctor ainât say dey wuz ter be tuck outside.â

[Illustration: â_âEf you think you kin stay in one place long enough,
Iâll try ter put you âcross de creekâ_â]

âOlâ Brer Yalligater float on de water like he ainât weigh no moâ dan
one er deze yer postitch stomps, anâ he try ter drop a tear. He groan, he
did, anâ float backerds anâ forrerds like a tired canoe. He say, âBrer
Rabbit, ef dey yever wuz a rover you is one. Up you come anâ off you go,
anâ dey ainât no moâ keepinâ up wid you dan ef you had wings. Ef you
think you kin stay in one place long enough, Iâll try ter put you âcross

âlow, sezee, âBrer âGater, how deep is dat water what you floatinâ in?â
Brer Yalligater say, sezee, âBrer Rabbit, ef me anâ my olâ âoman wuz ter

âBrer Rabbit, he fell back like he gwineter faint. He âlow, âBrer

make me feel like Iâm furder fum home and dem whatâs done lost fer good!
How de name er goodness you gwineter put me âcross dis slippery water?â
Brer Yalligater, he blow a bubble or two outân his nose, anâ den he say,
sezee, âEf you kin stay still in one place long ânough, Iâm gwineter take
you âcross on my back. You neeânter say thanky, yit I want you ter know
dat I ainât eveâybodyâs water-hoss.â Brer Rabbit he âlow, sezee, âI kin
well bâlieve dat, Brer âGater, but somehow, I kinder got a notion dat yoâ
tail mighty limber. I hear olâ folks say dat you kin knock a chip fum de

Yalligater smack his mouf, anâ say, sezee, âLimber my tail may be, Brer
Rabbit, anâ fur-reachinâ, but donât blame me. It wuz dat a-way when it
wuz âgun ter me. Itâs all jâinted up âcordinâ ter natur.â

âBrer Rabbit, he study anâ study, anâ de moâ he study, de wuss he like

âlow, sezee, âI speck what you say is someârs in de neighborhoods er de

Ef youâll ride up a leetle closer, Iâll make up my mind so I wonât keep

cork outân a pickle bottle. He ainât do like he in a hurry, kaze he drapt
a word er two about de wedder, anâ he say dat de water wuz mighty colâ
down dar in de slushes. But Brer Rabbit tuck notice dat when he smole
one er his smiles, he showâd up a double row er tushes, dat look like
deyâd do mighty good work in a saw-mill. Brer Rabbit, he âgun ter shake
like he havinâ a chill; he âlow, âI feel dat damp, Brer âGater, dat I
mought des ez well be in water up ter my chin!â Brer Yalligater ainât
say nothinâ, but he canât hide his tushes. Brer Rabbit look up, he look
down, anâ he look all arounâ. He ainât skacely know what ter do. He âlow,
âBrer âGater, yoâ back mighty roughninâ; how I gwine ter ride on it?â
Brer Yalligater say, sezee, âDe roughninâ will heâp you ter holâ on, kaze

BROTHER RABBIT AND MISS NANCY


One day, when Uncle Remus had told one of the stories that have already
been set forth, the little boy was unusually thoughtful. He had asked his
mother whether there was ever a time when the animals acted and talked
like people, and she, without reflecting, being a young and an impulsive
woman, had answered most emphatically in the negative. Now, this little
boy was shrewder than he was given credit for being, and he knew that
neither his grandmother nor Uncle Remus would set great store by what his
mother said. How he knew this would be difficult to explain, but he knew
it all the same. Therefore, when he interjected a doubt as to the truth
of the tales, he kept the name of his authority to himself.

âUncle Remus,â said the little boy, âhow do you know that the tales you
tell are true? Couldnât somebody make them up?â

The old man looked at the little child, and knew who had sown the seeds
of doubt in his mind, and the knowledge made him groan and shake his
head. âMaybe you think I done it, honey, but ef you does, de sooner you
fergit it offân yoâ minâ, de better fer you, kaze Iâd set here anâ dry
up anâ blow way âfoâ I kin tell a tale er my own make-up; anâ ef deyâs
anybody deze days what kin make um up, Iâd like fer ter snuggle up ter
âim, anâ ax âim ter lâarn me how.â

âDo you really believe the animals could talk?â asked the child.

âWhat diffunce do it make what I bâlieve, honey? Ef dey kin talk in
dem days, er ef dey canât, bâlievinâ er not bâlievinâ ainât gwineter
heâp matters. Olâ folks what live in dem times dey say de creeturs kin
talk, kaze dey done talk wid um, anâ dey tell it ter der chillun anâ der
chillun tell it ter der chillun right on down ter deze days. So den what
you gwineter do âbout it--bâlieve dem what had it fum de olâ folks dat
knowâd, er dem what ainât never hear nothinâ âtall about it twel dey git
it second hanâ fum a olâ nigger man?â

The child perceived that Uncle Remus was hitting pretty close to home, as
the saying is, and he said nothing for a while. âI havenât said that I
donât believe them,â he remarked presently.

âEf you said it, honey, you ainât say it whar I kin hear you, but I take
notice dat you holâ yoâ head on one side anâ kinder wrinkle yoâ face up
when I tell deze tales. Ef you donât bâlieve um, tainât no moâ use fer me
ter tell um dan âtis fer me ter fly.â

âMy face always wrinkles when I laugh, Uncle Remus.â

âAnâ when you cry,â responded the old man so promptly that the child
laughed, though he hardly knew what he was laughing at.

âIâm gwineter tell you one now,â remarked Uncle Remus, wiping a smile
from his face with the back of his hand, âanâ you kin take it er leave
it, des ez you please. Ef you see anything wrong in it anywhar, you kin
pâint it out ez we go âlong. I been tellinâ you dat Brer Rabbit wuz a
heap bigger in dem days dan what he is now. It looks like de fambly done
run ter seed, anâ I bet you dat ninety-nine thousanâ year fum dis veây
day, de Rabbit-tum-a-hash crowd wonâ be bigger dan fielâ-mice--I bet you
dat. He waânât only bigger, but he wuz mighty handy âbout a farm, when he
tuck a notion, speshually ef Mr. Man had any greens in his truck-patch.
Well, one time, times wuz so hard dat he hatter hire out fer his vittles
anâ cloze. He had de idee dat he wuz gittinâ a mighty heap fer de work
he done, an Mr. Man tell his daughter dat he gittinâ Brer Rabbit mighty
cheap. Dey wuz bofe satchified, anâ when datâs de case, eveâybody else
oughter be satchified. Brer Rabbit kin hoe taters, anâ chop cotton, anâ
fetch up breshwood, anâ split de kindlin, anâ do right smart.

âHe say ter hisseâf, Brer Rabbit did, dat ef he ainât gittinâ no money
anâ mighty few cloze, he bounâ heâd have a plenty vittles. De fust week
er two, he ainât cut up no shines; he wuz gittinâ usen ter de place. He
stuck ter his work right straight along twel Mr. Man say he one er de
besâ hanâs on de whole place, anâ he tell his daughter dat she better set
âer cap fer Brer Rabbit. De gal she toss her head anâ make a mouf, but
all de samey she âgun ter casâ sheep eyes at âim.

âOne fine day, when de sun shininâ mighty hot, Brer Rabbit âgun ter git
mighty hongry. He say he want some water. Mr. Man say, âDar de bucket,
anâ yanâ de spring. Eveâything fix so you kin git water monstus easy.â
Brer Rabbit git de water, but still dey wuz a gnyawinâ in his stomach,
anâ bimeby he say he want some bread. Mr. Man say, âTainât been so mighty
long sense you had brekkus, but no matter âbout dat. Yanâs de house, in
de house youâll finâ my daughter, anâ sheâll giâ you what bread you want.â

âWid dat Brer Rabbit put out fer de house, anâ dar he finâ de gal. She
say, âLa, Brer Rabbit, you oughter be at work, but stidder dat here you
is at de house. I hear pap say dat youer mighty good worker, but ef dis
de way you does yoâ work, I dunner what make âim sesso.â Brer Rabbit
say, âIâm here, Miss Nancy, kaze yoâ daddy sont me.â Miss Nancy âlow,
âAinât you âshame er yoâseâf fer ter talk dat a-way? You know pap ainât
sont you.â Brer Rabbit say, âYassum, he did,â anâ den he smole one er
deze yer lopsided smiles. Miss Nancy kinder hang âer head anâ low, âStop
lookinâ at me so brazen.â Brer Rabbit stood dar wid his eyes shot, anâ he
ainât say nothinâ. Miss Nancy say, âIs you gone ter sleep? You oughter be
âshame fer ter drap off dat a-way whar deyâs ladies.â

âBrer Rabbit make a bow, he did, anâ âlow, âYou tolâ me not ter look
at you, anâ ef I ainât ter look at you, I des ez well ter keep my eyes
shot.â De gal she giggle anâ say Brer Rabbit oughtnât ter make fun er
her right befoâ her face anâ eyes. She ax what her pap sont âim fer, anâ
he âlow dat Mr. Man sont âim for a dollar anâ a half, anâ some bread anâ
butter. Miss Nancy say she donât bâlieve âim, anâ wid dat she run down
todes de fielâ whar her pa wuz workinâ anâ holler at âim--âPap! Oh, pap!â
Mr. Man make answer, âHey?â anâ de gal say, âIs you say what Brer Rabbit
say you say?â Mr. Man he holler back dat datâs des what he say, anâ Miss
Nancy she run back ter der house, anâ giâ Brer Rabbit a dollar anâ a half
anâ some bread anâ butter.

âTime passed, anâ eveây once in a while Brer Rabbitâd go ter de house
endurinâ de day, anâ tell Miss Nancy dat her daddy say fer ter giâ âim
money anâ some bread anâ butter. Anâ de gal, sheâd go part er de way
ter whar Mr. Man is workinâ, anâ holler anâ ax ef he sesso, anâ Mr. Man
âd holler back, âYes, honey, dat what I say.â It got so atter while dat
dey ainât so mighty much money in de house, anâ âbout dat time, Miss
Nancy, she had a beau, which he useter come ter see her eveây Sunday, anâ
sometimes Satâday, anâ it got so, atter while, dat she wonât skacely look
at Brer Rabbit.

[Illustration: â_De beau got ter flinginâ his sass rounâ Brer Rabbit_â]

âDis make âim laugh, anâ he kinder studied how he gwineter git even wid
um, kaze de beau got ter flinginâ his sass rounâ Brer Rabbit, anâ de gal,
sheâd giggle, ez gals will. But Brer Rabbit des sot dar, he did, anâ chaw

grounâ des like he donât keer whedder anything happen er not. But dis
donât satchify Mr. Man, anâ he ax Brer Rabbit what de speech is. Brer
Rabbit âlow dat de way de little bird say it dey ainât no sense ter it
fur ez he kin see. But Mr. Man keep on axinâ âim what âtis, anâ bimeby

agâin, anâ she giâ im de money.â

âMr. Man say, âWhich money?â Brer Rabbit âlow, âYouer too much fer me.
Dey tells me dat moneyâs money, no matter whar you git it, er how you
git it. Ef de little bird waânât singinâ a song, den Iâm mighty much
mistooken.â But dis donâ make Mr. Man feel no better dan what he been
feelinâ. He went on workinâ, but all de time de speech dat de little bird
made wuz runninâ in his minâ:

XVI

THE HARD-HEADED WOMAN


Uncle Remus had observed a disposition on the part of the little boy
to experiment somewhat with his elders. The child had come down to the
plantation from the city such a model youngster that those who took an
interest in his behavior, and who were themselves living the free and
easy life possible only in the country places, were inclined to believe
that he had been unduly repressed. This was particularly the case with
the little fellowâs grandmother, who was aided and abetted by Uncle Remus
himself, with the result that the youngster was allowed liberties he had
never had before. The child, as might be supposed, was quick to take
advantage of such a situation, and was all the time trying to see how far
he could go before the limits of his privileges--new and inviting so far
as he was concerned--would be reached. They stretched very much farther
on the plantation than they would have done in the city, as was natural
and proper, but the child, with that adventurous spirit common to boys,
was inclined to push them still farther than they had ever yet gone; and
he soon lost the most obvious characteristics of a model lad.

Little by little he had pushed his liberties, the mother hesitating to
bring him to task for fear of offending the grandmother, whose guest she
was, and the grandmother not daring to interfere, for the reason that
it was at her suggestion, implied rather than direct, that the mother
had relaxed her somewhat rigid discipline. It was natural, under the
circumstances, that the little fellow should become somewhat wilful and
obstinate, and he bade fair to develop that spirit of disobedience that
will make the brightest child ugly and discontented.

Uncle Remus, as has been said, observed all these symptoms, and while
he had been the first to deplore the system that seemed to take all the
individuality out of the little fellow, he soon became painfully aware
that something would have to be done to renew the discipline that had
been so efficacious when the mother was where she felt free to exercise
her whole influence.

âYou ainât sick, is you, honey?â the old man inquired one day in an
insinuating tone. âKaze ef you is, you better run back ter de house anâ
let de white folks dose you up. Yoâ mammy knows des âzackly de kinder
physic you need, anâ how much, anâ ef I ainât mighty much mistooken,
âtwonât be so mighty long âfoâ sheâll take you in hanâ.â The child looked
up quickly to see whether Uncle Remus was in earnest, but he could find
nothing in that solemn countenance that at all resembled playfulness.
âYou may be well,â the old man went on, âbut deyâs one thing certain anâ
shoâ--you donât look like you did when you come ter we-allâs house, anâ
you donât do like you done. You may look at me ef you wanter, but Iâm
a-tellinâ you de fatal trufe, kaze you ainât no moâ de same chilâ what
useter âtenâ ter his own business all day anâ night--you ainât no moâ de
same chilâ dan Iâm dat olâ hen out dar. I âlowâd I mought be mistooken,
but I hear yoâ granny anâ yoâ mammy talkinâ tâer night atter you done
gone ter bed, anâ de talk dat dey talked shoâ did open my eyes, kaze I
never spected fer ter hear talk like dat.â

For a long time the little boy said nothing, but finally he inquired
what Uncle Remus had heard. âI ainât no eavesdrapper,â the old man
replied, âbut I hear ânough fer ter last me whiles you stay wid us. I
dunner how long datâll be, but I donât speck itâll be long. Now des
look at you! Dar you is fumblinâ wid my shoe knife, anâ mosâ âfoâ you
know it one eenâ er yoâ finger will be down dar on de floâ, anâ youâll
be a-squallinâ like somebody done killt you. Put it right back whar you
got it fum. Why nât you put it down when I ax you?--anâ donât scatter
my pegs! Put down dat awl! Youâll stob yoâseâf right in de vitals, anâ
den Miss Sally will blame me. Laws-a-massy! take yoâ hanâ outer dat peg
box! Youâll git um all over de floâ, anâ deyâll drap thoo de cracks. I
be bounâ ef I take my foot in my hanâ, anâ go up yanâ anâ tell yoâ mammy
how good you is, sheâll make you take off yoâ cloze anâ go ter bed--datâs
des âzackly what sheâll do. Anâ dar you is foolinâ wid my fillinâs!--anâ,
bless gracious, ef you ainât settinâ right flat-footed on my shoemakerâs
wax, anâ it right saft! Iâll hatter ax yoâ mammy ter pleaseâm not let you
come down here no moâ twel de day you start home!â

âI think you are very cross,â complained the child. âI never heard you
talk that way before. And grandmother is getting so she isnât as nice as
she used to be.â

âAh-yi!â exclaimed Uncle Remus in a triumphant tone. âI knowâd it! you
done got so dat you wonât do a blessed thing dat anybody ax you ter do.
You done got a new name, anâ âtainât so new but what I can put bofe hanâs
behime one, anâ shet my eyes anâ call it out. Eveâybody on de place know
what âtis, anâ I hear de olâ red rooster callinâ it out de yuther day
when you wuz chunkinâ at âim.â At once the little boy manifested interest
in what the old negro was saying, and when he looked up, curiosity shone
in his eyes. âWhat did the rooster say my name is, Uncle Remus?â

âWhy, when you wuz atter him, he flewâd up on de lot fence, anâ he âlow,
âMr. Hardhead! Mr. Hardhead!â anâ dat shoâ is yoâ name. You kin squirm,
anâ frown, anâ twisâ, but dat rooster is shoâ got yoâ name down fine. Ef
heâd âaâ des named you once, maybe folks would âaâ fergot it offân der
minâ, but he call de name twice des ez plain ez he kin speak, anâ dar you
sets wid Mr. Hardhead writ on you des ez plain ez ef de rooster had a
put it on you wid a paint-brush. You canât rub it off anâ you canât walk
rounâ it.â

âBut what must I do, Uncle Remus?â

âDes set still a minnit, anâ try ter be good. It may thâow you in a high
fever fer ter keep yoâ hanâs outer my things, er it may giâ you a agur
fer ter be like you useter be, but itâll pay you in de long run; it mosâ
sholy will.â

âWell, if you want me to be quiet,â said the child, âyouâll have to tell
me a tale.â

âEf you sit still too long, honey, Iâm afeard de creeturs on de
plantation will git de idee dat sumpân done happen. Darâs de olâ sow--you
ainât run her rounâ de place in de last ten minnits er sech a matter;
anâ darâs de calf, anâ de chickens, anâ de Guinny hens, anâ de olâ gray
gooses--deyâll git de idee dat you done broke yoâ leg er yoâ arm; anâ
deyâll be fixinâ up fer ter have a frolic if dey miss you fer longer dan
fifteen minnits anâ a half. How you gwineter have any fun ef you set anâ
lissen ter a tale stidder chunkinâ anâ runninâ de creeturs? I mosâ know
you er ailinâ anâ by good rights de doctor oughter come anâ look at you.â

The little boy laughed uneasily. He was not the first that had been
sobered by the irony of Uncle Remus, which, crude though it was, was much
more effective than downright quarreling. âYasser!â Uncle Remus repeated,
âde doctor oughter come anâ look at you--anâ when I say doctor, I mean
doctor, anâ not one er deze yer kinâ what goes rounâ wid a whole passel
er pills what ainât bigger dan a gnatâs heart. What you want is a great
big double-jâinted doctor wid a big black beard anâ specks on, whatâll
fill you full er de rankest kinâ er physic. Ez you look now, you put me
in minâ er de âoman anâ de dinner-pot; dey ainât no two ways âbout dat.â

âIf it is a tale, please tell it, Uncle Remus,â said the little boy.

âOh, it sho is a tale all right!â exclaimed the old man, âbut you ainât
no moâ got time fer ter hear it dan de birds in de tree. Youâd hatter
set still anâ lissen, anâ dat âud put you out a whole lot, kaze darâs de
chickens ter be chunked, anâ de pigs ter be crippled anâ a whole lot er
yuther things fer ter be did, anâ dey ainât nobody else in de rounâ worlâ
dat kin do it ez good ez you kin. Well, you kin git up anâ mosey long ef
you wanter, but Iâm gwineter tell dish yer tale ef I hatter râar my head
back anâ shet my eyeballs anâ tell it ter myseâf fer ter see ef I done
fergit it offân my minâ.

âWell, once âpon a time--it mought âaâ been in de year One fer all I
know--dey wuz a âoman dat live in a little cabin in de woods not so
mighty fur fum water. Now, dis âoman anâ dis cabin mought âaâ been in de
Nunited State er Georgy, er dey mought âaâ been in de Nunited State er
Yallerbammer--you kin put um whar you please des like I does. But at one
place er de yuther, anâ at one time er nuther, dis âoman live dar des
like Iâm a-tellinâ you. She live dar, she did, anâ fusâ anâ lasâ dey wuz
a mighty heap er talk about her. Some say she wuz black, some say she wuz
mighty nigh white, anâ some say she waânât ez black ez she mought be; but
dem what knowâd, dey say she wuz nine parts Injun anâ one part human, anâ
I speck datâs des ez close ter trufe ez we kin git in dis kinder wedder
ef we gwineter keep cool.

âFum all I kin hear--anâ I been keepinâ bofe years wide open, she wuz a
monstus busy âoman, kaze it wuz de talk âmongst de neighbors dat she done
a heap er things what she ainât got no business ter do. She had a mighty
bad temper, anâ her tongue wuz a-runninâ fum morninâ twel night. Folks
say dat âtwuz long anâ loud anâ mighty well hung. Dey lissen anâ shake
der head, anâ atter while word went rounâ dat de âoman done killt her
daughter. Ez ter dat, I ainât never is hear de rights un it; she mought,
anâ den agâin she moughtnât--dey ainât no tellinâ--but dey wuz one thing
certain anâ shoâ she done so quare, dat folks say she cut up des like a
Friday-born fool.

âHer olâ man, he done de best dat he could. He went âlong anâ tenâ ter
his own business, anâ when her tongue âgun ter clack, he sot down anâ
made fish-baskets, anâ ax-helves. But dat ainât make no diffunce ter de
âoman, kaze she wuz one deze yer kinâ what could quoil all day whedder
dey wuz anybody fer ter quoil at er not. She quoiled anâ she quoiled. De
man, he ainât say nothinâ but dis des make her quoil de moâ. He split up
kinâlinâ anâ chopped up wood, anâ still she quoilâ; he fotch home meal
anâ he fotch home meat, but still she quoilâ. Anâ she âfuse fer ter cook
what he want her to cook; she wuz hard-headed des like you, anâ sheâd
have her own way ef she died fer it.

âEf de man, he say, âPlease âm cook me some grits,â sheâd whirl in anâ
bile greens; ef he ax fer fried meat, sheâd bake him a hoe-cake er corn
bread. Ef he want roasâ tater sheâd bile him a mess er beans, anâ all de
time, sheâd be givinâ âim de wuss kinder sass. Oh, she wuz a honey! Anâ
when it come ter low-down meanness, she wuz rank anâ ripe. Sheâd take
de sparrer-grass what he fotch, anâ kindle de fire wid it. Sheâd burn
de sparâ-ribs anâ scorch de tripe, anâ sheâd do eveây kinder way but de
right way, anâ dat she wouldnât do, not ter save yoâ life.

[Illustration: â_Den he shuck a gourd-vine flower over de pot_â]

âWell, dis went on anâ went on, anâ de man ainât make no complaints; he
des watch anâ wait anâ pray. But atter so long a time, he see dat dat
ainât gwine ter do no good, anâ he tuck anâ change his plans. He spit in
de ashes, he did, anâ he make a cross-mark, anâ turn rounâ twice so he
kin face de sunrise. Den he shuck a gourd-vine flower over de pot, anâ
sumpân tolâ âim fer ter take his resâ anâ wait twel de moon come up. All
dis time de âoman, she wuz a quoilinâ, but bimeby, she went on âbout her
business, anâ de man had some peace; but not fer long. He ainât no more
dan had time fer ter put some thunderwood buds anâ some calamus-root in
de pot, dan here she come, anâ she come a-quoilinâ. She come in she did,
anâ she slam things rounâ des like you slams de gate.

âAtter kickinâ up a rippet, anâ makinâ de place hot ez she kin, de âoman
made a big fire unâ de pot, anâ flewâd rounâ dar des like she tryinâ fer
ter cook a shoâ ânough supper. She made some dumplinâs anâ flung um in de
pot; den she put in some peas anâ big pods er red pepper, anâ on top er
all she flung a sheepâs head. De man, he sot dar, anâ look straight at de
cross-mark what he done made in de ashes. Atterwhile, he âgun to smell
de calamus-root a-cookinâ anâ he knowâd by dat, dat sumpân wuz gwineter
happen.

âDe pot, it biled, anâ biled, anâ fusâ news you know, de sheepâs head
âgun ter butt de dumplinâs out, anâ de peas, dey flewâd out anâ rattled
on de floâ like a bag er bullets done busted. De âoman, she run fer ter
see what de matter is, anâ when she got close ter de pot de steam fum de
thunderwood hit her in de face anâ eyes anâ come mighty nigh takinâ her
breff away. Dis kinder stumped âer fer a minnit, but she had a temper big
ânough fer ter drag a bull down, anâ all she had ter do when she lose her
breff wuz ter fling her hanâs in de aâr anâ fetch a snort, anâ dar she
wuz.

âShe moughter been mad befoâ, but dis time she wuz mighty nigh plumâ
crazy. She look at de pot, anâ she look at her olâ man; she shot her
eyeballs anâ clinched her hanâs; she yerked off her head-hankcher, anâ
pulled her haâr loose fum de wroppinâ-strings; she stomped her foot, anâ
smashed her toofies tergedder.

âShe railed at de pot; she âlow, âWhat ail you, you black Dickunce? I
bâlieve youer de own brer ter de Olâ Boy! You been foolinâ wid me fer
de longest, anâ I ainât gwine ter put up wid it! Iâm gwineter tame you
down!â Wid dat, she flung off de homespun sack what she been wâarinâ anâ
run outer de house anâ got de ax.

âHer olâ man say, âWhar you gwine, honey?â She âlow, âIâm a gwine whar
Iâm a gwine, datâs whar Iâm a gwine!â De man, he ainât sponâ ter dat
kinder talk, anâ de âoman, she went out in back yard fer ter hunt fer de
ax. Look like she gwineter keep on gittinâ in trouble, kaze de ax wuz on
top er de wood what de man done pile up out dar. It wuz layinâ up dar,
de ax wuz, des ez slanchendicklar ez you please, but time it see her
cominâ----â

âBut, Uncle Remus!â the child exclaimed, âhow could the ax see her?â

The old negro looked at the little boy with an expression of amazed
pity on his face. He looked all around the room and then raised his eyes
to the rafters, where a long cobweb was swaying slowly in a breeze so
light that nothing else would respond to its invitation. Then he sighed
and closed his eyes. âI wish yoâ pa wuz here right now, I mosâ sholy
does--yoâ pa, what useter set right whar youer settinâ! You done been
raised in town whar dey canât tell a ax fum a wheelbarrer. Ax ainât got
no eye! Well, whoever is hear de beat er dat! Ef anybody else is got dat
idee, Iâll be much erbleege ef youâll show um ter me. Here you is mighty
nigh big ânough fer eat raw tater widout havinâ de doctor called in, anâ
a-settinâ dar sayinâ dat axes ainât got no eyes. Well, you ax yoâ granâma
when you go back ter de house anâ see what she say.

âNow, leâ me see; wharbouts wuz I at? Oh, yes! De ax wuz on top er
woodpile, anâ when it seed de âoman cominâ, it des turned loose anâ slip
down on de yuther side. It waânât tryinâ fer ter show off, like Iâve seed
some folks âfoâ now; it des turned loose eveâything anâ fell down on de
yuther side er de woodpile. Anâ whiles de âoman wuz gwin rounâ atter it,
de ax, it clum back on top er de woodpile anâ fell off on tâer side. Dem
what handed de tale down ter me ainât say how long de âoman anâ de ax
keep dis up, but ef a ax is got eyes, it ainât got but one leg, anâ it
must not âaâ been so mighty long âfoâ de âoman cotch up wid it--anâ when
she did she wuz so mad dat she could âaâ bit a railroad track in two, ef
deyâd âaâ been one anywharâs rounâ dar.

[Illustration: â_De ax, it clum back on top er de woodpile anâ fell off
on der side_â]

âWell, she got de ax, anâ it look like she wuz madder dan ever. De man,
he say, âBetter let de pot âlone, honey; ef you donât youâll sholy wish
you hadder.â De âoman, she squall out, âIâll let you âlone ef you fool
wid me, anâ ef I do you wonât never pester nobody no moâ.â Man, he say,
âIâm a-tellinâ you de trufe, honey, anâ dis may be de lasâ chance youâll
git ter hear it.â

âDe âoman raise de ax like she gwineter hit de man, anâ den it look like
she tuck a nâer notion, anâ she start todes de pot. De man, he âlow,
âYou better hear me, honey! You better drap de ax anâ go out doors anâ
cool yoâseâf off, honey!â It seem like he wuz a mighty safâ-spoken man,
wid nice feelinâs fer all. De âoman, she say, âDonât you dast ter honey
me--ef you does Iâll brain you stidder de pot!â De man smole a long smile
anâ shuck his head; he say, âAll de same, honey, you better pay âtention
ter deze lasâ words Iâm a-tellinâ you!â

âBut de âoman, she des keep right on. Sheâd âaâ gone faster dan what she
did, but it look like de ax got heavier eveây step she tuck--heavier anâ
heavier. Anâ it look like de house got bigger--bigger anâ bigger; anâ
it seem like de doâ got wider--wider anâ wider! She moughter seed all
dis, anâ I speck she did, but she des keep right on, shakinâ de ax, anâ
moufinâ ter herseâf. De man, he holler once moâ anâ fer de lasâ time,
âDonât let olâ Nick fool you, honey, ef you does, he sho will git you!â

âBut she keep on anâ keep on, anâ de house got bigger anâ de doâ got
wider. De pot see her cominâ, anâ it got fum a-straddle er de fire, whar
it had been settinâ at, anâ skipped outâ de doâ anâ out in de yard.â
Uncle Remus paused to see what effect this statement would have on the
child, but save the shadow of a smile hovering around his mouth, the
youngster gave no indication of unbelief. âDe âoman,â said Uncle Remus,
with a chuckle that was repressed before it developed into a laugh, âlook
like she âstonishâ, but her temper kepâ hot, anâ she run out atter de pot
wid de ax ez high ez she kin holâ it; but de pot keep on gwine, skippinâ
long on three legs faster dan de âoman kin run on two; anâ de ax kepâ on
gittinâ heavier anâ heavier, twel, bimeby, de âoman hatter drap it. Den
she lit out atter de pot like she wuz runninâ a foot-race, but fast ez
she run, de pot run faster.

[Illustration: â_Den she lit out atter de pot like she wuz runninâ a
foot-race_â]

âDe chase led right inter de woods anâ down de spring branch, anâ away
over yander beyanâ de creek. De pot went so fast anâ it went so fur dat
atter while de âoman âgun ter git weak. But de temper she had helt âer up
fer de longest, anâ moâ dan dat, eveây time sheâd sorter slack up, de pot
would dance anâ caper rounâ on its three legs, anâ do like itâs givinâ
her a darâ--anâ she keep a-gwine twel she canât hardly go no furder.

âDe man he stayed at de house, but de âoman anâ de pot ainât git so fur
but what he kin hear um scufflinâ an scramblinâ rounâ in de bushes, anâ
he set dar, he did, anâ look like he right sorry fer anybody whatâs ez
hard-headed ez de âoman. But she look like she bleeze ter ketch dat pot.
She say ter herseâf dat folks will never git done talkinâ âbout her ef
she let herseâf be outdone by a olâ dinner-pot what been in de fambly
yever sence dey been any fambly.

âSo she keep on, twel she tripped up on a vine er de bamboo brier, anâ
down she come! It seem like de pot seed her, anâ stidder runninâ fum âer,
here it come a-runninâ right at âer wid a chunk er red fire. Oh, you kin
laugh, honey, anâ look like you donât bâlieve me, but dat ainât make no
diffunce, kaze de trufe ainât never been hurted yit by dem what ainât
bâlieve it. I dunner whar de chunk er fire come fum, anâ I dunner how
de dinner-pot come ter have motion, but dar âtis in de tale--take it er
leave it, des ez you bleeze.

âWell, suh, when de âoman fell, de pot made at her wid a chunk er red
fire. De âoman see it cominâ, anâ she set up a squall dat moughter been
heard a mile. She jump up, she did, but it seem like she wuz so weak anâ
tired dat she canât stanâ on her foots, anâ she start fer ter fall agâin,
but de dinner-pot wuz dar fer ter ketch âer when she fell. Anâ dat wuz de
last dat anybody yever is see er de hard-headed âoman. Leasâ ways, she
ainât never come back ter de house whar de man wuz settinâ at.

âDe pot? Well, de way dey got it in de tale is dat de pot des laugh
twel it hatter holâ its sides fer ter keep fum crackinâ open. It come
a-hoppinâ anâ a-skippinâ up de spring paff. It hopped along, it did, twel
it come ter de house, anâ it made a runninâ jump in de doâ. Den it wash
its face, anâ scrape de mud offân it foots, anâ wiped off de grease what
de âoman been too lazy fer ter clean off. Den it went ter de fireplace,
anâ kinder spraddle out so itâll fit de bricks what been put dar fer it
ter set on.

âDe man watch all dis, but he ainât say nothinâ. Atter while he hear a
mighty bilinâ anâ bubblinâ anâ when he went ter look fer ter see what de
matter, he see his supper cookinâ anâ atter so long a time, he fish it
out anâ eat it. He eat in peace, anâ atter dat he allers had peace. Anâ
when you wanter be hard-headed, anâ have yoâ own way, you better bâar in
minâ de âoman anâ de dinner-pot.â

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
