_PREFACE_


_The collection of these humorous paragraphs has extended over a
number of years. Even a small beginning became a source of such
entertainment that the collection grew and grew, always without any
thought of publication._

_The man who can not laugh has yet to be found. Therein lies that
immediate appeal to a common ground which the sense of humor gives,
and it has been a conspicuous characteristic of those who look to the
public for appreciation and support. Lord Palmerston and Abraham
Lincoln were two notable examples of men for whom sympathy quickened
through their ready wit, and no political speaker drives home his
arguments half so well as he who can introduce a witty illustration.
The joke has ever been a potent factor in combating oppression and
corruption, in ridiculing shams. It has embalmed some reputations, and
has blasted others. It is the champion of the weak against the strong,
and has often illuminated for us, as in a flash, a glimpse of
character or custom that would otherwise have been lost to the world._

_There is only one similar collection of which I am aware, the âJest
Bookâ by Mark Lemon, who was for twenty-nine years the editor of
âPunch.â Alas that there should be fashions in jokes as well as in
hats, for much of his book that we know must have been humorous
reading to his contemporaries, leaves us, of the present generation in
America, indifferent._

_I shall be glad if some of my readers are minded to do a graceful act
and send me, in return, some paragraphs to add to my collection._

_I wish to take this opportunity to thank the following publications
for the paragraphs borrowed from their columns:_

AMONG THE HUMORISTS AND AFTER-DINNER SPEAKERS


There is a delicious flavor about this story of a Virginia lady,
married to a man who, though uniformly unsuccessful in his hunting
trips, boastingly spoke of his âkillings.â

One day, returning from a trip, with the usual accompaniment of an
empty bag, it occurred to him that his wife would make fun of him if
he returned without even one proof of his oft-boasted skill. So he
purchased a brace of partridges to deceive his trusting spouse. As he
threw them on the table in front of her, he observed: âWell, my dear,
you see I am not so awkward with the gun after all.â

âDick,â replied the wife, turning from the birds with a grimace, after
a brief examination, âyou were quite right in shooting these birds
to-day; to-morrow it would have been too late.â

          *     *     *     *     *

Uncle Toby was aghast at finding a strange darky with his arm around
Mandyâs waist.

âMandy, tell dat niggah to take his ahm âway from round yoâ waist,â he
indignantly commanded. âTell him yoâself,â said Mandy haughtily. âHeâs
a puffect stranger to me.â

A Cockney tourist was on a visit to a Highland town famous for its
golf-links. Through wearing a pair of stiff leather gaiters several
sizes too large for him, he was compelled to walk bow-legged. Being a
very slow player, others were forced to wait for him at every hole. At
the fourth hole a Highlander after watching the visitor miss the ball
three times was unable to wait any longer, and drove his ball clean
between the touristâs legs. âWhat!â he of the gaitered legs yelled
furiously. âDo you call that golf?â âMebbe no,â replied the Gael, âbut
itâs very good croquet.â

          *     *     *     *     *

After the sermon on Sunday morning the rector welcomed and shook hands
with a young German.

âAnd are you a regular communicant?â said the rector.

âYes,â said the German, âI take the 7.45 every morning.â

          *     *     *     *     *

Meeting a negro, a certain Southern gentleman asked him how he was
getting on.

The negro assumed a troubled look, and replied:

âOh, so farâs physicality goes, Iâm all right; but I sure do have ma
troubles wif ma wife.â

âWell, Sam, Iâm sorry to hear that. What seems to be the matter?â

âShe thinks money grows on trees, I reckon. All de time she keeps
pesterinâ me foh pinch oâ change. If it ainât a dollah itâs half or a
quarter she wants.â

âWhat on earth does she do with the money?â

âI dunno. Ainât nevah give her none yet.â

          *     *     *     *     *

A mountaineer of one of the back counties of North Carolina was
arraigned with several others for illicit distilling. âDefendant,â
said the court, âwhat is your name?â

âJoshua,â was the reply.

âAre you the man who made the sun stand still?â

Quick as a flash came the answer, âNo, sir; I am the man who made the
moonshine.â

          *     *     *     *     *

âThey thought more of the Legion of Honor in the time of the first
Napoleon than they do now,â said a well-known Frenchman. âThe emperor
one day met an old one-armed veteran.

ââHow did you lose your arm?â he asked.

ââSire, at Austerlitz.â

ââAnd were you not decorated?â

ââNo, sire.â

ââThen here is my own cross for you; I make you chevalier.â

ââYour Majesty names me chevalier because I have lost one arm! What
would your Majesty have done had I lost both arms?â

ââOh, in that case I should have made you Officer of the Legion.â

âWhereupon the old soldier immediately drew his sword and cut off his
other arm.â

There is no particular reason to doubt this story. The only question
is, how did he do it?

          *     *     *     *     *

A stranger in Boston was interested to discover, when dining with
friends once, that the dessert he would have classed as cream layer
cake at home was known in Boston as âWashington pie.â And the next
time he lunched at a restaurant, he ordered the same thing; but the
waiter put before him a rather heavy looking square of cake covered
with chocolate, instead of the cream cake the guest had made up his
mind to enjoy. A puzzled expression came over his face as he said
reprovingly, âI ordered _Washington_ pie, waiter.â

âThat is Washington pie, sir.â

âWell,â expostulated the disappointed man, âI did not mean Booker
T.--I want _George!_â

          *     *     *     *     *

George Ade, automobiling in Indiana, dined at a country hotel among a
roomful of ministers.

The ministers, who were holding a convention in the town, were much
amused when Mr. Adeâs identity was disclosed to them.

One of them said during dinner:

âHow does a humorist of your stamp feel, sir, in such reverend company
as this?â

âI feel,â said Mr. Ade promptly, âlike a lion in a den of Daniels.â

          *     *     *     *     *

It was a crowded tram car. Among those who could not find seats was a
young lady. Close to where she stood an old man was sitting. He
struggled as if to rise. The young woman cast a glance of scorn at one
or two men hiding behind newspapers. âPlease donât get up,â she said
to the old man, âI beg you wonât.â The conductor rang the bell and the
car went on. The old manâs features worked convulsively and he mopped
his face with his handkerchief. At the next stopping place he again
tried to rise and again the young woman tried to stop him. âI would
much rather stand,â she said, continuing to block his way. âI donât
care whether you would or not,â said the old man, crimson with fury,
âI want to get out. Youâve made me come half a mile too far already.
Here, you, stop the car.â But it was too late, the bell had already
rung and he had to wait until the next stopping place was reached.

âI want some cigars for my husband for Christmas.â

âWhat kind, madam?â

âWell, I donât know, exactly; but he is a middle-aged man and always
dresses in black.â

          *     *     *     *     *

John D. Rockefeller, Jr., tells a story of his father:

âFather tells many stories. Sometimes he tells a new one. Not long ago
he related one to me that concerned a man who had imbibed rather too
freely. The man, in this condition, fell into a watering trough. To
the officer who came to help him out as he wallowed in the water, he
said:

ââOffzer, I ken save self. You save women anâ shildern.ââ

          *     *     *     *     *

âOn Sunday, September 20, the wife of ---- of a daughter. Others
please copy.â

Bret Harte was so frequently complimented as the author of âLittle
Breechesâ that he was almost as sorry it was ever written as was
Colonel John Hay, who preferred his fame to rest on more ambitious
works. A gushing lady who prided herself upon her literary tastes,
said to him once: âMy dear Mr. Harte, I am so delighted to meet you. I
have read everything you ever wrote, but of all your dialect verse
there is none that compares to your âLittle Breeches.ââ

âI quite agree with you, madam,â said Mr. Harte, âbut you have put the
little breeches on the wrong man.â

          *     *     *     *     *

Mr. Knox, the Secretary of State in Taftâs Cabinet, was formerly
engaged in the practise of law in Pittsburg.

One day, says a friend, Mr. Knox was much put out to find on his
arrival at his office that everything was topsy-turvy and that the
temperature of his rooms was much too low for comfort. Summoning his
office-boy, a lad but recently entered his employ, the lawyer asked
who had raised every window in the place on such a cold morning.

âMr. Muldoon, sir,â was the answer.

âWho is Mr. Muldoon?â asked the attorney.

âThe janitor, sir.â

âWho carried off my waste-basket?â was the next question.

âMr. Reilly, sir.â

âAnd who is Mr. Reilly?â

âHeâs the man that cleans the rooms.â

Mr. Knox looked sternly at the boy and said: âSee here, Richard, we
call men by their first names here. We donât âmisterâ them in this
office. Do you understand?â

âYes, sir.â And the boy retired.

In a few minutes he reappeared and in a shrill, piping voice
announced:

âThereâs a gentleman that wants to see you, Philander.â

          *     *     *     *     *

A Scottish parson, still on the under side of forty, was driving home
from an outlying hamlet when he overtook a young woman. He recognized
her as the maid of all work at a farm which he would pass, so he
pulled up and offered her a lift. Mary gladly accepted his offer and
they chatted pleasantly all the way to the farm gate.

âThank you, sir,â she said as she got down.

âDonât mention it, Mary. Donât mention it,â he told her politely.

âNo, I wonât,â Mary obligingly assured him.

A little girl was shown her newly-arrived baby brother. Looking at him
lovingly she said, âWhen will he talk, mother?â âOh not for a long
time yet,â said the mother. âYes, but when?â persisted the child.
âWell, not for a year or so.â After thinking for minute the child
exclaimed, âHow funny. Miss Clark read out of the Bible this morning
that Job cursed the hour he was born.â

W. A. Sponsler, when in the Pennsylvania State Legislature, was given
to the making of very elaborate and florid speeches, and one day
brought an address to a close with â_Vox populi, vox Dei_.â

âIâll bet you donât know the meaning of what Sponsler just said,â said
Al Crawford to Hugh E. Mackin.

âI donât know!â replied Mackin, indignantly. âOf course, I know!â

âYou donât know for ten dollars!â suggested Crawford.

Mackin, still indignant, posted his part of the wager with another
member of the Legislature, and Crawford said tauntingly:

âWell, now, tell us, what does it mean?â

â_Vox populi, vox Dei_,â quoted Mackin, solemnly, âas everybody knows,
is French for âMy God! why hast thou forsaken me?ââ

âGive him the money,â said Crawford. âDarned if he donât know after
all!â

There is an old lady living in a small town in southern Pennsylvania
who makes great efforts to keep abreast of the times. Her
opportunities, however, are circumscribed, and she is sometimes
compelled to resort to her imagination. She went to a church sociable
lately, and as she entered the room one of the attendants said:

âGood evening, auntie. I am glad you came. We are going to have
tableaux this evening.â

âYes, I know,â replied the old lady; âI smelt âem when I first came
in.â

Fifer was a dog of friendly and social habits, but when he wandered
into the lecture-tent at a well-known New Thought summer school and
went to sleep between the chairs, he did a very foolish thing. A woman
coming in poked him in the ribs with her parasol, startling him from
his peaceful dreams, and he sprang upon her with a savage bite. A man
grabbed him and he grabbed the man. The excitement was intense when an
earnest little woman standing on a chair cried, âSome one hold the
Thought!â âHang the Thought!â shouted a man in the rear. âSome one
hold the dog!â

The boy was going away to school, full of high hope.

âI shall make the football team and color two pipes the first year!â
he said bravely.

His mother kissed him and wept. His father wrung his hand in silence.

They were too full for speech then.

But when he was gone, and they were calmer, they talked together of
him, and prayed his ambition might not carry him beyond his strength.

The car was entirely empty with the exception of one man, but as I
entered he rose, made me an unsteady but magnificent bow, and said:
âMadam, pleashe be kind ânough to asshept thish plashe.â

There was nothing else for me to do, so I thanked him and sat down.
And for twenty blocks that idiot hung from a strap, swaying in the
breeze, with not a soul in the car but ourselves. Occasionally I have
been taken for other women; but I never before had any one think that
I was a carful.

Husband (after the theater)--âWell, how do you like the piece?â

Wife--âVery much. Thereâs only one improbable thing in it. The second
act takes place two years after the first, and they have the same
servant.â

Thomas Hill (the original âPaul Pryâ) was endeavoring one evening to
cut up an orange in such a fashion as to represent a pig. After
strewing the table with about a dozen peels, he gave up the futile
experiment, saying, âHang the pig! I canât make him at all.â

âNonsense, Hill,â said Theodore Hook, pointing to the table; âyou have
done splendidly. Instead of a pig you have made a litter.â

An elderly churchwarden in shaving himself one Sunday before
church-time made a slight cut with the razor on the extreme end of his
nose. Quickly calling to his wife, he asked her if she had any
court-plaster in the house. âYou will find some in my sewing basket,â
she said. The warden soon had the cut covered. At church in assisting
with the collection he noticed everyone smile as he passed the plate,
and some of the younger people laughed outright. Very much annoyed, he
asked a friend if there was anything wrong with his appearance.
âWell, I should think there is,â was the answer. âWhat is that on your
nose?â âCourt-plaster.â âNo,â said his friend, âit is the label from a
reel of cotton. It says, âWarranted 200 yd. long.ââ

A man who stuttered very badly went to a specialist, and after ten
difficult lessons learned to say quite distinctly, âPeter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.â His friends congratulated him upon this
splendid achievement.

âYes,â said the man, doubtfully, âbut itâs s-s-such a d-d-deucedly
d-d-d-difficult rem-mark to w-work into an ordin-n-nary
c-c-convers-s-sa-tion, yâ know.â

A visitor to a Sunday-school was asked to address a few remarks to the
children. He took the familiar theme of the children who mocked Elisha
on his journey to Bethel--how the youngsters taunted the poor old
prophet and how they were punished when two she bears came out of the
wood and ate forty-and-two of them. âAnd now, children,â said he,
wishing to learn if his talk had produced any moral effect, âwhat does
this story show?â âPlease, sir,â came from a little girl well down in
the front, âit shows how many children two she bears can hold.â

A curate who had left his parish on account of the attentions of his
lady parishioners, meeting his successor one day in the street asked
him how he got on in his new position. âVery well indeed,â returned
the other. âBut are not the ladies rather pressing in their
attentions?â âOh, my dear fellow, I manage that all right, I find
safety in Numbers.â âI see,â returned his companion, âwell, I found
safety in Exodus.â

âI want some collars for my husband,â said a lady in a department
store, âbut I am afraid I have forgotten the size.â

âThirteen and a half, maâam?â suggested the clerk.

âThatâs it. How on earth did you know?â

âGentlemen who let their wives buy their collars for âem are almost
always about that size, maâam,â explained the observant clerk.

On a recent occasion before leaving Marlborough House new clothes were
ordered for Prince Edward, and according to custom a tailoress was
sent to fit him at a time which would not interfere with his lessons.
The tailoress duly arrived and was ushered to the Princeâs
sitting-room, but on the door being opened she paused as she saw that
a gentleman, whose face was turned toward the fireplace, was sitting
smoking and chatting with the children. Prince Edward, whose manner is
most friendly, at once ran forward and told her to come in, and seeing
that she still hesitated added in a reassuring voice, âYou neednât
mind, itâs only grandpapa.â

A physician engaged a nurse, recently graduated, for a case of
delirium tremens. The physician succeeded in quieting his patient and
left some medicine, instructing the nurse to administer it to him if
he âbegan to see snakes again.â At the next call the physician found
the patient again raving. To his puzzled inquiry the nurse replied
that the man had been going on that way for several hours, and that
she had not given him any medicine.

âBut didnât I tell you to give it to him if he began to see snakes
again?â asked the physician.

âBut he didnât see snakes this time,â replied the nurse confidently.
âHe saw red, white, and blue turkeys with straw hats on.â

Shortly after his entrance into political life Disraeli stood for a
certain Middlesex borough in the Conservative interest. It was a
âpersonally conductedâ canvass, and, among others, the future Prime
Minister solicited the vote and interest of a well-to-do but somewhat
irascible farmer, who was supposed to be rather doubtful in his
political convictions.

âVote for you!â he shouted when Mr. Disraeli made known the object of
his call. âWhy, Iâd vote for the devil sooner.â

âAh, quite so!â said Mr. Disraeli, suavely, âbut in event of your
friend not standing, may I hope for your interest?â

President Lincoln once wrote to General McClellan, when the latter was

to borrow it for a while.

A well-known New York clergyman was telling his Bible class the story

with the then Prince of Wales, now King Edward. Among the courses was
one of asparagus, a delicacy unknown to the Shah. He considered it for
a time, discovered that the head alone was nice to eat, ate it
accordingly and flung the rest of the stalk over his shoulder. The
other diners were somewhat flabbergasted, but the tactful Prince, not
wishing his Persian guest to feel that he had done anything
ridiculous, promptly followed his example, throwing his own stalks
over his shoulder. Naturally all the courtiers imitated him in turn,

One of his grandmaâs maids of honor tells the following story of
Prince Eddie when he was a few years younger:

Just after King Edwardâs coronation, when he underwent an operation
for appendicitis and was lying convalescent, he sent for his
grandchildren.

The little ones trooped into the room, cautioned by their nurse that
they must keep very quiet, and stood about their grandfatherâs bed. He
talked with them for a few minutes and they replied in awed whispers.
Then when the nurse told them they must go, Prince Eddie said:

âBut, grandpa, canât we see the baby?â

Rossettiâs fondness for humorous stories and his interest in a
particular soldier of fortune, or rather of misfortune, are shown in
Hall Caineâs autobiography. Beginning life as the secretary of Ruskin,
the man ultimately lived on his cleverness and audacity and made
Rossetti in particular his conscious and delighted victim. Feeble as
Rossetti was, the visits of this man did him good, and he laughed all
the evening and told droll stories himself. One of the latter was of a
man near to death to whom the clergyman came and said: âDear friend,
do you know who died to save you?â âOh, meenister, meenister,â said
the dying man, âis this a time for conundrums?â

It is interesting to recall, apropos of the recent Milton celebration,
an anecdote of Milton that was told in an old family letter written in
1762, recently quoted in the columns of the London âSpectatorâ:

âPossibly you may not have heard this anecdote concerning him. John
Vallack--who, I believe, died after you came to Tavistock--told me it,
and he lived in London in 1696. Milton, as you know, was blind.
Charles the Second had the curiosity to see him, and said: âGod hath
punished you for your malice, etc., to my father by taking away your
eyesight.â

ââAye,â says Milton, âbut before I lost my eyes he lost his head.ââ

company?â

That famous Scotch physician, Dr. George Fordyce, was unfortunately
somewhat given to drink, and though he never was known to be dead
drunk, yet he was often in a state which rendered him unfit for
professional duties. One night when he was in such a condition, he was
suddenly sent for to attend a lady of title who was very ill. He went,
sat down, listened to her story, and felt her pulse. He found he was
not up to his work. He lost his wits and in a moment of forgetfulness
exclaimed, âDrunk, by Jove!â Still he managed to write out a mild
prescription. Early next morning he received a message from the noble
patient to call on her at once. Dr. Fordyce felt very uncomfortable.
The lady evidently intended to upbraid him either for giving an
improper prescription or for his disgraceful condition, but to his
surprise and relief she thanked him for his prompt compliance with her
pressing summons, and then confessed that he had rightly diagnosed her
case. That unfortunately she occasionally indulged too freely in
drink, but that she hoped he would preserve inviolable secrecy as to
the condition in which he had found her. Fordyce listened to her as
grave as a judge, then said:

âMadam, you may depend on me. I shall be as silent as the grave.â

A friend of Dean Swift one day sent him a turbot as a present by a
servant lad who had frequently been on similar errands but had never
received anything from the dean for his trouble. Having gained
admission he opened the study door, and putting down the fish on the
floor cried out rudely, âMaster has sent you a turbot.â âYoung man,â
said the dean rising from the chair, âis that the way you deliver a
message? Let me teach you better manners. Sit down in my chair; we
will change places, and I will show you how to behave in future.â The
boy sat down, and the dean going out came up to the door, and making a
low bow said, âSir, master presents his kind compliments, hopes you
are well, and requests your acceptance of a small present.â âDoes he?â
replied the boy. âReturn him my best thanks, and thereâs half-a-crown
for yourself.â The dean thus caught in his own trap laughed heartily
and gave the boy a crown for his ready wit.

us all,â he said. âI illustrated by saying that the Father knows which
of us grows best in sunlight and which of us must have shade. âYou
know you plant roses in the sunshine,â I said, âand heliotrope and
geraniums; but if you want your fuchsias to grow they must be kept in
a shady nook.â After the sermon, which I hoped would be a comforting
one, a woman came up to me, her face glowing with pleasure that was
evidently deep and true. âO, Dr. ----, I am so grateful for that
sermon,â she said, clasping my hand and shaking it warmly. My heart
glowed for a moment, while I wondered what tender place in her heart
and life I had touched. Only for a moment, though. âYes,â she went on,
fervently, âI never knew before what was the matter with my
fuchsias.ââ

There are some singular discounts allowed in the book trade. They were
happily illustrated on one occasion by Mark Twain. One day while the
humorist was connected with a publishing house he went into a book
store and picking up a volume asked the price. He then suggested that
as a publisher he was entitled to 50 per cent discount. To this the
clerk assented.

âAs I am also an author,â said Mark, âit would appear that I am again
entitled to 50 per cent discount.â

Again the clerk bowed.

âAnd as a personal friend of the proprietor,â he modestly continued,
âI presume that you will allow me the usual 25 per cent. discount.â

Another bow from the salesman.

âWell,â drawled the unblushing humorist, âunder these conditions I
think I may as well take the book. Whatâs the tax?â

The clerk took out his pencil and figured industriously. Then he said
with the greatest obsequiousness:

âAs near as I can calculate we owe you the book and about 37-1/2
cents.â

Clyde Fitch tells a new story of Whistler. The artist was in Paris at
the time of the coronation of King Edward, and at a reception one
evening a duchess said to him: âI believe you know King Edward, Mr.
Whistler.â

âNo, madame,â replied Whistler.

âWhy, thatâs odd,â she murmured; âI met the King at a dinner-party
last year, and he said that he knew you.â

âOh,â said the painter, âthat was just his brag.â

A London friend who was a member of the same club as Mr. Whistler
writes me this, which I have not seen before in print. It seems that
the gentle artist in making enemies had not paid his dues and was
dunned for them in vain. He either took no notice of requests for a
settlement, or replied to them with his usual airy mockery. Finally
the secretary wrote to him:

_âDear Mr. Whistler_--It is not a Nocturne in Purple, or a Symphony in
Blue and Gray, that we are after, but An Arrangement in Gold and
Silver.â

Here is another story typical of the great maker of enemies:

Whistler had a French poodle of which he was extravagantly fond. The
poodle was seized with an affection of the throat, and Whistler had
the audacity to send for the great throat specialist Mackenzie.

Sir Morell, when he saw that he had been called in to treat a dog,
didnât like it much, it was plain. But he said nothing. He prescribed,
pocketed a big fee, and drove away.

The next day he sent post-haste for Whistler; and Whistler, thinking
he was summoned on some matter connected with his beloved dog, dropped
his work and rushed like the wind to Mackenzieâs.

On his arrival Sir Morell said gravely:

âHow do you do, Mr. Whistler? I wanted to see you about having my
front door painted.â

A story is told of a very popular cavalry officer. He was being tried
for drunkenness, and among other witnesses was his Irish orderly. The
court, anxious to give the officer every chance, put several questions
to this witness with a view of eliciting any facts that might be in
his masterâs favor. When the orderly said that his master, on going to
bed, had expressed a wish to be called early, the members of the
court-martial were distinctly pleased.

A man who gave special instructions to be called early could not,
surely--they argued to themselves--have been drunk. Hoping to get
favorable particulars, the judge advocate put a further question.

âAnd why did the major wish to be called early?â he asked.

âFaith, anâ he tould me it was because he was to be Queen of the May,â
came the answer.

Joe Jefferson had but one person with him who did not reverence the
man and the name.

This individual, one Bagley by name, was the property man and annoyed
the great comedian with undue familiarity. He had called Mr. Jefferson
âJoeyâ during his entire thirty yearsâ service.

Just previous to an auspicious opening in one of the big cities, Mr.
Jefferson discharged Bagley for humiliating him before a number of
friends. Bagley got drunk right away, and that night paid his way to
the gallery to see Mr. Jefferson present âRip Van Winkle.â The angry
Frau has just driven poor, destitute Rip from the cottage when Rip
turns and, with a world of pathos, asks: âDen haf I no interest in
dis house?â The house is deathly still, the audience half in tears,
when Bagleyâs cracked voice responds: âOnly eighty per cent,
Joey--only eighty per cent.â

Dean Hole, the noted English clergyman who died recently, was the
leading figure in many humorous stories. On one occasion he was
crossing the Channel after a visit to the Continent, the voyage being
very stormy.

The Dean was a bad sailor and had suffered a great deal on the trip.
At Dover he was looking over the railway companyâs rules on the
station wall as a passenger came up. Said the Dean: âAfter that stormy
voyage we have at least one advantage in making the subsequent trip to
London. I see the company carries returning empties at reduced rates.â

Gilbert Stuart, though a celebrated artist, was likewise a great
braggart. On one occasion a great public dinner was given to Isaac
Hull by the town of Boston, and he was asked to sit for his picture to
the artist.

When Hull visited the studio Stuart took great delight in entertaining
him with anecdotes of his English success, stories of the marquis of
this and the baroness of that, which showed how elegant was the
society to which he had been accustomed.

Unfortunately, in the midst of this grandeur, Mrs. Stuart, who did not
know that there was a sitter, came in with apron on and her head tied
up with some handkerchiefs, from the kitchen, and cried out: âDo you
mean to have that leg of mutton boiled or roasted?â to which Stuart
replied, with great presence of mind, âAsk your mistress.â

This story is related of an old-time Judge in Sullivan County, N. Y.:

During a session of court there was so much talking and laughter going

Irving Bacheller, the author of âEben Holden,â went a little farther
north than usual one summer while on his vacation, and penetrated
Newfoundland. He caught a good many fish, but this did not prevent his
keeping an eye on the natives. He was particularly impressed by the
men who spent the day lounging about the village stores.

âWhat do you fellows do when you sit around the store like this?â he
asked of the crowd arranged in a circle of tilted chairs and empty
boxes and maintaining a profound silence.

âWell,â drawled one of the oldest, âsometimes we set and think, and
then again other times we jest set.â

Not long before his death Thomas B. Reed visited some friends at their
summer residence at Watch Hill, R. I. Late in the afternoon he was
driven up to Westerly to take the 7 oâclock train for Boston. It was
a warm evening, the horses lagged and he missed the train, the last
Boston-bound train stopping at Westerly that night.

As Mr. Reed had an important engagement in Boston early the next day,
he seemed worried until he learned that there was a Boston express
which passed Westerly at 9 oâclock. Then he smiled.

Going to the telegraph office, he directed a telegram to the
superintendent of the road in Boston, and sent the following message:

âWill you stop the 9 oâclock express at Westerly to-night for a large
party for Boston.â

The answer came: âYes. Will stop train.â

Mr. Reed read the message, and smiled. When the train pulled in Mr.
Reed quietly started to board it, when the conductor said: âWhere is
that large party we were to stop for?â

âI am the large party,â replied Mr. Reed, and he boarded the train.

The Prince of Wales is fond of telling a good story to his friends in
connection with his visit to Ottawa some few years ago. The
Prince--then Duke of York--stole away for a quiet bicycle spin early
one morning, and in his ramblings met a farmer, heading marketward,
his wagon temporarily stalled by the loss of a nut belonging to the
whiffletree bolt. His Royal Highness, with his usual democratic
kindness, assisted him in putting things right. On parting, the farmer
expressed his rough thanks and asked if he might know the name of the
person to whom he was indebted. The royal cyclist replied modestly: âI
am the Duke of York. And may I ask whom I have the pleasure of
addressing?â A broad, amused smile beamed from the farmerâs face as he

Once, during his second term, Grover Cleveland was asked to speak at a
function in a certain town, and when he arrived at the depot the wind
was blowing a gale, sleet was driving, and hailstones nearly as large

was there, and at the sight of the President the performers struck up

âThat is the most realistic music I ever heard,â remarked Cleveland.

No amount of persuasion or punishment could keep Johnnie from running
away. The excitement of being pursued and of being brought back to a

slight discomfort that sometimes followed.

Finally his mother determined upon a new method. She decided, after

whatever should be taken of it. He should stay away as long as he
pleased and return when he saw fit.

In a few days the youngster again disappeared. His mother was firm in

A big, burly, fierce-looking man and a meek, inoffensive-looking
little chap were sawing timber with a cross-cut saw. A strapping
Irishman, passing that way, stopped to watch them. Back and forth,

stand it no longer. With a whoop and a yell he rushed at the big man
and brought him to the ground, burying his knees deep into the
sawyerâs chest.

Biff! Bang! Thump! Biff!

Oliver Herford once entered a doubtful-looking restaurant in a small
New York town and ordered a lamb-chop. After a long delay the waiter
returned, bearing a plate on which reposed a dab of mashed potatoes
and a much overdone chop of microscopical proportions with a
remarkably long and slender rib attached. This the waiter set down
before him and then hurried away.

âSee here,â called Herford, âI ordered a chop.â

âYessir,â replied the man, âthere it is.â

âAh, so it is,â replied Herford, peering at it closely. âI thought it
was a crack in the plate.â

In one of the elevators of a city skyscraper, as the elevator shot
toward the zenith, a stout man began to sputter. âBub-but,
rt-st-st-bârârâr,â he said, as the veins stood out upon his neck. At
the twenty-third story the stout manâs eyes were nearly starting from
his head, and as he grasped the arm of the elevator man the latter
nervously pulled the lever, and the lift started for the bottom at a
terrific rate. The solitary passenger danced about, gurgling
spasmodically. As the car struck bottom, however, he rushed through
the door and up to an important individual, whose cap bore the screed
âStarter.â âS-s-s-say,â he sputtered, ât-t-this is the th-th-third

Some of Darwinâs boy friends once plotted a surprise for the
naturalist. They slew a centipede, glued on it a beetleâs head, and
also added to its body the wings of a butterfly and the long legs of a
grasshopper. Then they put the new insect in a box and knocked at the
great manâs door. âWe found this in the fields,â they cried with eager
voices. âDo tell us what it can be.â Darwin looked at the strange
compound and then at the boysâ innocent faces. âDid it hum when you
caught it?â he asked. âOh yes, sir,â they answered quickly, nudging
one another, âit hummed like anything.â âThen,â said the philosopher,
âit is a humbug.â

The customs of military service require officers to visit the kitchens
during cooking hours to see that the soldiersâ food is properly
prepared. One old colonel, who let it be pretty generally known that
his orders must be obeyed without question or explanation, once
stopped two soldiers who were carrying a soup-kettle out of a kitchen.

âHere, you,â he growled, âgive me a taste of that.â

One of the soldiers ran and fetched a ladle and gave the colonel the
desired taste. The colonel spat and spluttered.

âGood heavens, man! You donât call that stuff soup, do you?â

âNo, sir,â replied the soldier meekly, âitâs dishwater we was

The ship upon clearing the harbor ran into a half-pitching,
half-rolling sea, that became particularly noticeable about the time
the twenty-five passengers at the captainâs table sat down to dinner.

âI hope that all twenty-five of you will have a pleasant trip,â the
captain told them as the soup appeared, âand that this little
assemblage of twenty-four will reach port much benefited by the
voyage. I look upon these twenty-two smiling faces much as a father
does upon his family, for I am responsible for the safety of this

in drinking to a merry trip. I believe that we seven fellow passengers

passenger list these three persons for my table. You and I, my dear,

âExtra Billyâ Smith, the Confederate General, was one of the most
irascible as well as one of the most patriotic of men. Upon one
occasion he was leading a regiment on a long and difficult march.
Weary and exhausted they halted for a rest by the wayside. When it
became necessary to move on, the General gave the order, but the tired
men remained stretched upon the ground. The order was repeated
peremptorily. Still no motion. By this time the temper of the General
was at white heat. He thundered out:

âIf you donât get up and start at once Iâll march the regiment off and
leave every d----d one of you behind.â

day, âwas handed to me in New York not long ago. I was visiting there
and had a little time to myself, so I bought a paper and went down to
the river front. I saw an advertisement in the paper saying that a tug
was to be auctioned off that day, so I went to the place and stood
around examining the tug. After a while a man who had been watching me
came over and began asking questions. I told him I was interested in
boats and was from Philadelphia. Then he asked: âWhat are you doing
down here?â âI came down to this auction sale,â I said. âWell,â said
the man, âif you want to keep on the right side of the boys youâll do
something for me. Hereâs $100; do not bid on the tug.â I took the
money and departed. I had not the slightest intention of bidding.â

A bride and groom had been much troubled by the stares of people at
hotels wherever they went. So when they arrived at the next hotel the
groom called the colored head-waiter.

âNow, George,â he said, âwe have been bothered to death by people
staring at us because we are just married. We want to be free from
that sort of thing here. Now, hereâs two dollars, and remember I trust
you not to tell people that we are just married, if they ask you.
Understand?â

âYas, sah!â said George; âI unâstand.â

All went well that day. But the following morning when the couple came
down to breakfast the staring was worse than ever. Chambermaids in the
hall snickered; the clerks behind the desk nudged each other;
everybody in the dining-room stared. When the couple returned to their
room it was only to see a head sticking out of nearly every room down
the long hall.

This was too much.

This _was_ the limit!

Angered beyond control, the groom went to the desk and called for the
head-waiter.

âLook here, you old fool,â said the groom, âdidnât I give you two
dollars to protect my wife and myself from the staring business?â

âYas, sah, you did,â said George. ââPon me soul, I didnât tell, sah.â

than anywhere. Did anybody ask if we were married?â

shooting in 1873 with old Emperor William of Germany and Victor

their way. They were drenched to the skin, and, in search of shelter,
hailed a peasant driving a covered cart drawn by oxen along the high
road. The peasant took up the royal trio and drove on.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, like other men of genius, was absent-minded, and,
when a fit of inspiration seized him, he was oblivious to the things
of earth to a ludicrous extent. A story that is vouched for as true
illustrates this.

The old-fashioned matches, in use in New England in Emersonâs time,
were made in cards, or flat slabs, the matches being joined at the
foot, and separating at the top, like the teeth of a deep comb.
Emerson was accustomed, in the midnight watches, to lie awake
communing with his own thoughts, and, if any especial inspiration
developed itself, he would get up and write it down, lighting the lamp
for that purpose.

One night, Mrs. Emerson was awakened by her gifted husbandâs voice, as
he called to her plaintively:

âWhat is the matter with the matches, my dear? I have struck seven,
and not one will light. Where can I get some good ones?â

Mrs. Emerson got out of bed at once, and found the matches in their
accustomed place. Her husband had not touched them.

âWhy, what can you have been striking, in mistake for matches?â she
asked, anxiously, and beheld her best carved tortoise-shell comb,
which the absorbed philosopher, had broken up, tooth by tooth, in
mistake for the card of matches.

him a revolver of the latest American pattern.

âHe slept peacefully enough until the clock struck two, when he awoke
with an unpleasant feeling of oppression. He raised his head and
peered about him. The room was wanly illumined by the full moon, and
in that weird, bluish light he thought he discerned a small, white
hand clasping the rail at the foot of the bed.

ââWhoâs there?â he asked tremulously.

âThere was no reply. The small, white hand did not move.

ââWhoâs there?â he repeated. âAnswer me or Iâll shoot.â

âAgain there was no reply.

âSnooks cautiously raised himself, took careful aim and fired.

When the Rev. Dr. Henson, then of Chicago, came to the New York
Chautauqua to lecture on âFools,â Bishop Vincent introduced him thus:

âLadies and gentlemen, we are now to have a lecture on âFoolsâ by one
of the most distinguished----â

Here there was a long pause, the Bishopâs inflection indicating that
he had finished. The audience roared with delight, and roared again,
so that it was some time before the sentence was concluded--âmen of
Chicago.â

Dr. Henson, who is a man of ready wit, stepped to the front of the
platform, and said:

âLadies and gentlemen, I am not so great a fool as Bishop Vincent----â
and then he paused as if he had finished, and the audience went fairly
wild over the situation. When quiet was restored, Dr. Henson
concluded--âwould have you think.â

Every employee of the Bank of England is required to sign his name in
a book on his arrival in the morning, and, if late, must give the
reason therefor. The chief cause of tardiness is usually fog, and the
first man to arrive writes âfogâ opposite his name, and those who
follow write âditto.â One day, however, the first late man gave as the
reason, âwife had twins,â and twenty other late men mechanically
signed âdittoâ underneath.

At a dinner in Washington there was told a Scotch story of a
parishioner who had strayed from his own kirk.

âWhy werenât you at the kirk on Sunday?â asked the preacher of the
culprit on meeting him a day or two later.

âI was at Mr. McClellanâs kirk,â said the other.

âI donât like you running about to strange kirks like that,â continued
the minister. âNot that I object to your hearing Mr. McClellan, but
Iâm sure you widna like your sheep straying into strange pastures.â

âI widna care a grain, sir, if it was better grass,â responded the

Perish the thought that the novelist or playwright should be tied down
to historical accuracy! Lady Dorothy Neville quotes an amusing
correspondence between Bulwer Lytton and her brother, Horace Walpole.

âMy dear Walpole: Here I am at Bath--bored to death. I am thinking of
writing a play about your great ancestor Sir Robert. Had he not a
sister Lucy, and did she not marry a Jacobite?â

Walpole promptly replied:

âMy dear Lytton: I care little for my family, and less still for Sir
Robert, but I know that he never had a sister Lucy, so she could not
have married a Jacobite.â

However, this mattered little to Lord Lytton, for his answer ran:

âMy dear Walpole: You are too late! Sir Robert _had_ a sister Lucy,
and she _did_ marry a Jacobite.â

So in defiance of history, the play âWalpoleâ was written.

sentry duty, one night, when a friend brought him a pie from the
canteen.

âAs he sat on the grass eating pie, the major sauntered up in undress
uniform. The sentry, not recognizing him, did not salute, and the
major stopped and said:

ââWhatâs that you have there?â

ââPie,â said the sentry, good-naturedly. âApple pie. Have a bite?â

âThe major frowned.

ââDo you know who I am?â he asked.

ââNo,â said the sentry, âunless youâre the majorâs groom.â

âThe major shook his head.

ââGuess again,â he growled.

ââThe barber from the village?â

ââNo.â

ââMaybe--â here the sentry laughed--âmaybe youâre the major himself?â

ââThatâs right. I am the major,â was the stern reply.

âThe sentry scrambled to his feet.

ââGood gracious!â he exclaimed. âHold the pie, will you, while I

Bishop Brewster, of Connecticut, while visiting some friends not long
ago, tucked his napkin in his collar to avoid the juice of the
grapefruit at breakfast. He laughed as he did it, and said it reminded
him of a man he once knew who rushed into a restaurant and, seating
himself at a table, proceeded to tuck his napkin under his chin. He
then called a waiter and said, âCan I get lunch here?â âYes,â
responded the waiter in a dignified manner, âbut not a shampoo.â

A man and his wife were once staying at a hotel, when in the night
they were aroused from their slumbers by the cry that the hotel was
afire.

âNow, my dear,â said the husband, âI will put into practise what I
have preached. Put on all your indispensable apparel and keep cool.â

Then he slipped his watch into his vest pocket and walked with his
wife out of the hotel. When all danger was past, he said, âNow you see
how necessary it is to keep cool.â

The wife for the first time glanced at her husband.

âYes, William,â she said, âit is a grand thing, but if I were you I
would have put on my trousers.â

One evening as the mother of the little niece of Phillips Brooks was
tucking her snugly in bed the maid stepped in and said there was a
caller waiting in the parlor. The mother told the child to say her
prayers and promised that she would be back in a few minutes.

The caller remained only a short time, and when the mother went
upstairs again she asked the little girl if she had done as she was
bidden.

âYes, mama, I did and I didnât,â she said.

âWhat do you mean by that, dear?â

âWell, mama, I was awfully sleepy, so I just asked God if he wouldnât

Expecting a visit from the superintendent of an adjacent Sunday-school
one Sunday afternoon, one enterprising teacher, anticipating the line
of questions which would be asked of the scholars selected a boy from
her class to answer each question. As she had figured it out, the
visitor would first ask the pupils the question, âWho made you?â and
the first pupil was, of course, to answer âGod.â The next question was
to be âOf what?â to which the answer was to be âOf the dust of the
earth.â Unfortunately between the time that Sunday-school was called
to order and the visiting superintendent took the floor, the first
pupil was taken sick and obliged to go home. The teacher did not have
the opportunity to readjust her forces, and when the first question
was asked, the second boy thought it a good opportunity for him to get
in his answer and have it off his mind; so to the question, âWho made
you?â he answered, âOf the dust of the earth.â

âOh, no,â said the visitor. âGod made you.â

âNo, sir; He did not,â said the youngster. âThe little boy that God
made has gone home sick, and I am the dust of the earth.â

When General Grant was in London on his trip around the world he was
invited to Windsor Castle by Queen Victoria. The queen received the
party in one of the private audience chambers and chatted with General
Grant for a few moments before dinner was served.

Jesse Grant, then a small boy, was with the general, and stood just
behind him. As the general was talking, Jesse pulled impatiently at
his coat-tails a number of times. Finally, the general turned
half-way, and Jesse whispered:

âPa, canât I be introduced?â

âYour Majesty,â said the general, âI should like to present my son,
Master Jesse.â

The queen shook Jesseâs hand cordially, and that young man, thinking
it incumbent on him to say something, glanced approvingly around the
room and said: âFine house you have here, maâam.â

the notice immediately after the sermon. The clerk, however, had a
notice of his own to give out with reference to the baptism of
infants. Accordingly, at the close of the sermon he arose and
announced that âAll those who have children whom they wish to have
baptized please send in their names at once to the clerk.â The
clergyman, who was stone deaf, assumed that the clerk was giving out
the hymn-book notice, and immediately rose and said: âAnd I should
say, for the benefit of those who havenât any, that they may obtain
some from the ushers any day from three to four oâclock; the ordinary
little ones at twenty-five cents each, and special ones at fifty
cents.â

Clyde Fitch, the brilliant playwright, said of a jeweled watch that
had been sent him by a Scotch admirer in Peebles:

âA jeweled watch from Peebles. How strangely unexpected! It reminds me
of an open-air performance of âAs You Like Itâ that I once rehearsed.

âI rehearsed this amateur performance in a garden that was overlooked
by a building operation. As my amateurs postured and chanted the
bardâs beautiful lines, bricklayers above us laid bricks, carpenters
planed boards, and masons chipped stones.

âAnd one afternoon, during a silent pause in our rehearsal, we heard a
voice from the building operation say gravely:

ââI prithee, malapert, pass me yonder brick.ââ

A clergyman who was very popular with his congregation saw a lady
about to call whom he was anxious not to meet. So he said to his
wife:

âIâll run upstairs, my dear, and escape till she goes away.â

After about an hour he quietly tiptoed to the stair landing and
listened. All was quiet below. Reassured, he began to descend, and
called out over the balustrade:

âWell, my dear, you got rid of that old bore at last?â

The next instant a voice from below rooted him to the spot. It was the
voice of the caller! Then came a response which sounded inexpressibly
sweet to him. It was the voice of his wife:

âYes, dear, she went away over an hour ago; but here is our good
friend, Mrs. Blank, whom I am sure you want to meet.â

A lady and her little daughter were walking through a fashionable
street when they came to a portion of the street strewn with straw, so
as to deaden the noise of vehicles passing a certain house.

âWhatâs that for, ma?â said the child, to which the mother replied,
âThe lady who lives in that house, my dear, has had a little baby girl

straw, and said: âAwfully well packed, wasnât she, ma?â

A politician, upon his arrival at one of the small towns in North
Dakota, where he was to make a speech the following day, found that
the two so-called hotels were crowded to the doors.

Not having telegraphed for accommodations, the politician discovered
that he would have to make shift as best he could.

He was compelled for that night to sleep on a wire cot which had only
some blankets and a sheet on it. As the statesman is a fat man, he

William Waldorf Astor, before he set out for his English home, said,
apropos of the Russo-Japanese War: âNations engaged in war not only
harm each other, but they lay themselves open to harm at the hands of
all sorts of other nations. In fact, two nations at war are in the
defenseless and gullible position of a certain English married couple.

âThis couple will fall out and cease to speak to one another for a
year or more at a time. They have a beautiful country house, and there
is a certain elderly matron, a great bore, who visits them
continually. Some one asked this matron which of the pair was always
inviting her. She answered, frankly, âNeither invites me ever, but
since they donât speak to each other, each always thinks I am the
otherâs guest.ââ

They were talking over the carelessness of well-to-do people who, by
overlooking their small bills, frequently bring disaster upon the
tradesmen who are trying to do business on a small capital.

âIt sometimes happens that these poor devils have two or three times
the amount of their capital out in bills that if paid promptly would
make their commercial ways a path of roses,â said the economist.
âLittle bills of three, four, and five dollars, not much in
themselves, mount up high in the aggregate, and it sometimes happens
that a seeming prosperity, through the failure of a lot of customers
to pay their bills within a reasonable time, results in ruin.

âAnd yet,â said the reminiscencer, âit sometimes works the other way.
I heard a story in England once of a harness dealer who on entering
his shop one afternoon, after an absence of several hours, noticed
that a rather handsome saddle that he had had in stock had
disappeared. He made immediate inquiry of his salesmen, and one of
them informed him that he had sold it to a gentleman who had come to
the shop with his trap, that the purchaser had thrown it into his
wagon and driven off, after telling him to charge it. Unfortunately,
however, he had forgotten to ask the gentlemanâs name, and all effort
to identify him by description failed.

ââWell,â said the shopkeeper, who was an ingenious man, âthere is only
one thing left to be done. We will charge the saddle up on all our
outstanding accounts. Those who did not buy the saddle will, of
course, call our attention to our error, and the man who did take it
will, of course, pay.â

âThis method was adopted, and at the beginning of the next month the
bills were sent out accordingly. Two weeks later the saddler
approached his cashier, and asked if he had heard as yet about the
matter. âHow about that missing saddle, Marcus?â he asked. âWe are
doing very well, sir,â replied the cashier. âForty of our customers
have paid for it, and only two have discovered the mistake.ââ

The story is told of a young Oregon girl, a favorite in society, but
who was poor and had to take care not to get her evening gowns soiled,
as their number was limited. At a dance not long ago a great, big,
red-faced, perspiring man came in and asked her to dance. He wore no
gloves. She looked at the well-meaning moist hands despairingly, and
thought of the immaculate back of her waist. She hesitated a bit, and
then she said, with a winning smile:

âOf course I will dance with you, but if you donât mind, wonât you
please use your handkerchief?â

The man looked at her blankly a moment or two. Then a light broke over
his face.

âWhy, certainly,â he said.

And he pulled out his handkerchief and blew his nose.

terribly interesting?â Everybody listened to hear the great manâs
brilliant reply, for as a Shakespearian scholar he has few peers.
âYes,â he said, solemnly, âI do think he is interesting. I think he is
more than that. I think Shakespeare is just simply too cute for
anything.â

A well-known Scotch professor was occasionally called up to Balmoral
to attend the late Queen Victoria, and was extremely proud of the
honor. One day a notice appeared in the university which stated that
Professor ---- could not attend his classes that day as he had been
called up to Balmoral to see the Queen. A waggish student who saw the
notice wrote underneath it, âGod save the Queen.â

âThe other day,â said a man passenger in a street-car, âI saw a woman
in a street-car open a satchel and take out a purse, close the satchel
and open the purse, take out a dime and close the purse, open the
satchel and put in the purse. Then she gave the dime to the conductor
and took a nickel in exchange. Then she opened the satchel and took
out the purse, closed the satchel and opened the purse, put in the
nickel and closed the purse, opened the satchel and put in the purse,
closed the satchel and locked both ends. Then she felt to see if her
back hair was all right, and it was all right, and she was all right.
That was a woman.â

As a couple of callers were in the parlor of a friend who is a firm
Christian Scientist, the voice of five-year-old Florence could be
heard from an upper room, fretting. Upon their inquiries about her
the mother replied simply she was suffering from a âbeliefâ in a boil.

One of the visitors was a rather grim great-aunt of the family who
possesses a most lively scorn of Mrs. Eddyâs so-called science as well
as a deep-rooted affection for little Florence. She immediately
demanded what had been applied for her relief and as naturally the
answer was, âNothing.â She assumed her most decided expression, drew
off her gloves and started upstairs.

âAunt Molly, what are you going to do? I must repeat it is only a
belief in a boil,â expostulated the mother.

âVery well,â retorted Aunt Molly, continuing her march upstairs, âI am
merely going to put on a dream of a poultice.â

When the thermometer dropped below zero Mrs. Rogers was much disturbed
by the thought that Huldah, the new kitchen maid, slept in an unheated
room.

âHuldah,â she said, remembering the good old custom of her girlhood,
âitâs going to be pretty cold to-night. I think you had better take a
flatiron to bed with you.â

âYes, maâam,â assented Huldah without enthusiasm.

Mrs. Rogers, happy in the belief that her maid was comfortable, slept
soundly. In the morning she visited the kitchen.

âWell, Huldah, how did you get along with the flatiron?â

Huldah breathed a deep sigh of recollection.

âVell, maâam, I got it âmost warm before morning.â

In proof of this, read these veritable specimens of definitions,
written by public-school children:

âStability is taking care of a stable.â

âA mosquito is the child of black and white parents.â

âAnatomy is the human body, which consists of three parts, the head,
the chist, and the stummick. The head contains the eyes and brains, if
any. The chist contains the lungs and a piece of the liver. The
stummick is devoted to the bowels, of which there are five, a, e, i,
o, u, and sometimes w and y.â

Little Polly, coming in from her walk one morning, informed her mother
that she had seen a lion in the park. No amount of persuasion or

night, when she slipped down on her knees to say her prayers, her
mother said, âPolly, ask God to forgive you for that fib.â

Polly hid her face for a moment. Then she looked straight into her

Two candidates for office in Missouri were stumping the northern part
of the State. In one town their appearance was almost simultaneous.
The candidate last arriving stopped at a house for a drink of water.
To the little girl who answered his knock at the door he said--when
she had given him the desired drink and he had offered her some candy
in recompense:

âDid the man ahead of me give you anything?â

âOh, yes,â replied the girl. âHe gave me candy.â

âAh!â exclaimed the candidate. âHereâs five cents for you. I donât
suppose that _he_ gave you any money?â

The youngster laughed. âYes, he did, too! He gave me ten cents!â

Not to be outdone, the candidate gave the little one another nickel
and picking her up in his arms, kissed her.

âDid he kiss you, too?â he asked genially.

âYes, he did, sir,â responded the little girl, âand he kissed ma,

Senator W. A. Clark detests nothing more than to be interrupted when
busy. One day he was in his office engaged in a business conversation
when a petite woman, carrying a black bag, entered. With a compelling
smile and an insinuating manner she approached the surly millionaire.
Utterly insensible to his repellent mood and indifferent to his abrupt
manner she drew from the depths of a bag a handsomely bound volume,
the merits and beauty of which she began eloquently to descant upon.

Failing to embarrass her with arctic frigidity and impatient at her
persistency under rebuffs all but vulgar, he turned suddenly upon the
chattering woman and asked:

âMadam, do you know what my time is worth?â

She confessed it was a conundrum.

âWell,â he said, petulantly, âitâs worth $30 an hour!â

He turned away with the air of one who had settled the matter
definitely beyond any further controversy. But he didnât know the
woman.

âOh, Iâm so grateful to you, Mr. Clark,â she replied, with a tone of
pathos in her voice. âThirty dollars an hour, did you say?â

âYes; thatâs what I said, and itâs cheap at that,â and he smiled
cynically.

âOh, I know itâs dirt cheap,â she chirped with winsome blitheness. âI
am so glad you told meâ--rummaging in her reticule, from which she
quickly flashed out a purse gorged with currency. Moving near to the
astonished millionaire, who now regarded her movements with unfeigned
curiosity, she counted two bills, a ten and a five, off the roll.
These she pushed along the top of the sloping desk toward him and
said: âYes, Iâm glad you told me, because I hadnât expected to get it
so cheap. There is $15. Now, I want a half hour of your uninterrupted
attention while I talk to you about this book.â

Clark pushed the money back and subscribed and paid for two copies of
the book.

A dear old New England spinster, the embodiment of the timid and
shrinking, passed away at Carlsbad, where she had gone for her health.
Her nearest kinsman, a nephew, ordered her body sent back to be
buried--as was her last wish--in the quiet little country churchyard.
His surprise can be imagined, when on opening the casket, he beheld,
instead of the placid features of his aunt Mary, the majestic port of
an English General in full regimentals, whom he remembered had chanced
to die at the same time and place as his aunt.

A clergyman was on board a steamer which was caught in a severe gale.
The rolling was constant and seemed to get worse as time went on. At
last the good man got thoroughly frightened. He believed they were
destined for a watery grave, so he went to the captain and asked if he
might have prayers. The captain took him by the arm and led him to the
forecastle, where the tars were singing and swearing. âThere,â said
he, âwhen you hear the men swearing you may know there is no danger.â
The clergyman went back feeling better, but still the storm increased
and his alarm also. Disconsolate, he managed to stagger to the
forecastle again, where he heard the sailors swearing as hard as ever.
âMary,â he said to his sympathetic wife as he crawled back to his
berth, âMary, thank God, theyâre swearing yet.â

tired of this and to John, when we got a new cook, I said: Donât ever
call me by my first name in the cookâs presence. Then, perhaps, not
knowing my name, heâll have to say âMrs.â to me. So John was careful
to address me as âdearie,â or âsweetheart,â the watchful chap gave me
no title at all. One day we had some English officers to dine. I told
them how I had overcome, in my new cookâs case, the native servantsâ
abuse of their employerâs Christian names, and I said, By this
servant, at least, you wonât hear me called âAnn.ââ Just then the new
cook entered the room. He bowed to me respectfully and said:

rooms of his house. They waited until midnight, then started to do the
job.

In order to get the money they had to pass the farmerâs bedroom. Mike

and, looking at the tremendous boots before him, the arab knelt down
on the pavement and shouted out to his chum across the road, âJamie,
come ower anâ gieâs a hand, Iâve got an army contract.â

The younger man had been complaining that he could not get his wife to
mend his clothes.

âI asked her to sew a button on this vest last night, and she hasnât
touched it,â he said. At this the older man assumed the air of a
patriarch.

âNever ask a woman to mend anything,â he said. âYou havenât been
married very long, and I think I can give you some serviceable
suggestions. When I want a shirt mended I take it to my wife, flourish
it around a little and say, âWhereâs that rag-bag?â

ââWhat do you want of the rag-bag?â asks my wife. Her suspicions are
roused at once.

ââI want to throw this shirt away; itâs worn out,â I say, with a few
more flourishes.

ââLet me see that shirt,â my wife says then. âNow, John, hand it to me
at once.â

âOf course, I pass it over, and she examines it. âWhy, John Taylor,â
she is sure to say, âI never knew such extravagance! This is a
perfectly good shirt. All it needs is----â And then she mends it.â

âNow, see here, porter,â said the drummer briskly, âI want you to put

should get out. Hereâs a five-dollar gold piece. Now, I may wake up

A right reverend prelate, himself a man of extreme good-nature, was
frequently much vexed in spirit by the proud, froward, perverse, and
untractable temper of his next vicar. The latter, after an absence
much longer than usual, one day paid a visit to the bishop, who kindly
inquired the cause of his absence, and was answered by the vicar that
he had been confined to his house for some time past by an obstinate
stiffness in his knee. âI am glad of that,â replied the prelate; ââtis
a good symptom that the disorder has changed place, for I had a long

ââPass you in? What for?â he asked.

Why, because I am Oliver Goldsmith, author of the play.â

While Chauncey M. Depew was at the Omaha Exposition, he and President
Callaway of the New York Central chanced to go into a booth on the
Midway Plaisance.

It was a tame entertainment and there was only a meager attendance
when Mr. Depew and Mr. Callaway entered. Their stay would have been
very brief except for the fact that they had scarcely taken their
seats before there began a steady inpouring of people, which continued
until the small auditorium was crowded.

Taking this extraordinary increase of spectators as an indication that
something of an interesting nature was about to be disclosed, the two
New Yorkers concluded to sit it out. Half an hourâs waiting failed to
reward their patient expectancy, however, and Mr. Callaway suggested
that they move on.

Just then ex-Secretary of Agriculture J. Sterling Morton pushed his
way through the crowd, and, extending his hand to Mr. Depew,
exclaimed:

âWell, Doctor Depew, so you are really here! I thought that âbarkerâ

seeing the âgreat and only Chauncey M. Depew.ââ

which was reached by a very long ladder. At the foot I was met by an
angel, who pressed a piece of chalk into my hand and said, âIf you
climb long enough you will reach Heaven, but for every sin you are
conscious of having committed you must mark a rung of the ladder with
the chalk as you go up.â I took the chalk and started. I had climbed
up very, very far and was feeling very tired when I suddenly met my
vicar coming down. âHullo!â I said, âwhat are you going down for?â

Laying it down, he smiled and said: âOnce I was spending the evening

Little Alice is old for her years. One evening after she had gone to
bed she heard mama and papa laughing in much enjoyment over a game of
flinch; she longed to get up and join them, but knew she must not. The
next morning at breakfast she was very quiet. Presently she drew a
deep sigh, and said, âWhat a good time you and papa had last night.
Oh, I feel the need of a husband, mama, I _do_ feel it!â

A teacher in one of the primary schools of New York recently read to
her pupils âThe Old Oaken Bucket.â

After explaining the song to them very carefully, she asked the class
to copy the first stanza from the blackboard, where she had written
it, and try to illustrate the verse by drawings in the same way a
story is illustrated.

In a short while one little girl handed up her paper with several
little dots between two lines, a circle, half a dozen dots, and three
buckets.

âI do not quite understand this, Mamie,â said the teacher, kindly.
âWhat is that circle?â

âOh, thatâs the well,â Mamie replied.

âAnd why do you have three buckets?â again asked the teacher.

âOne,â answered the child, âis the oaken bucket, one is the iron-bound
bucket, and the other is the moss-covered bucket that hung in the
well.â

âBut, Mamie, what are all these little dots for?â

âWhy those are the spots which my infancy knew,â earnestly replied
Mamie.

At a recent dinner in London the conversation turned to the subject of
lynching in the United States. It was the general opinion that a large
percentage of Americans met death at the end of a rope. Finally the
hostess turned to an American, who had taken no part in the
conversation, and said:

âYou, sir, must have often seen these affairs.â

âYes,â he replied, âwe take a kind of municipal pride in seeing which
city can show the greatest number of lynchings yearly.â

Mrs. Jones recently spent a few days at a farm, and in a moment of
originality bought some poultry from the farmer with a view to their
providing fresh eggs for breakfast every morning. She sent them to
town per the local carrier, despatching a note at the same time to her
husband telling him to look out for the consignment. When Jones
reached home from his office he inquired if the poultry had arrived.
The servant told him they had, but the man had carelessly put them in
the back yard, leaving the door open, and they had all escaped.
Thereupon a fowl hunt was immediately organized. The next day Jones
saw the carrier. âNice trick you played me yesterday,â said he; âspent
three hours hunting those fowls and only found ten.â âThen think
yourself blessed lucky,â replied the man. âI only brought six.â

the amusing methods of a newspaper writer who used to write articles
at a set rate a column.

He was once commissioned to do a serial story for a Chicago paper. The
story, as it proceeded from week to week, was interesting, but it
contained many passages like the following:

âDid you hear him?â

âI did.â

âTruly?â

âTruly.â

âWhere?â

âHereafter we will pay you by the letters in your serial. We will pay
you so much a thousand letters.â

The young man, looking crestfallen, went away, but in the very next
instalment of his story he introduced a character who stuttered, and
all through the chapter were scattered passages like this:

Hiram Hardscrabble and his load of hay, two horses, and a perfectly
good wagon were pitched so high and so far by a reckless railroad
train that when they came down they werenât--any of âem--good for
much. The local Congressman took the case, and after some months
advised Hiram to accept the railroad companyâs offer of lifelong
employment at $15 a week. Hiram accepted. They put him out as a
flagman on a crossing near his native village.

Cassidy, the section boss, stopped his handcar before the flag-shanty,
and after a searching look at Hiram advised as follows:

âSo youâre the new flagman, are ye? And yeâve niver railroaded before.
No harm. Weâll make a man iv ye. See, now, thereâs yer red flag and
yer green flag and yer white flag, and yer thrain schedule within on
the wall. All ye have to do is dhrop the gates befoor the thrains do
come, so that theyâll have a clear thrack. Dâye mind, now?

âBut thereâs wan thing above all others--thâ Impire Shtate Express!
Putt yer gates down two minyits before she comes and keep them down
till sheâs pasht. Mind now, she must niver be late on this section.
Niver wan minyit late. I wonât sthand fâr it. Remimber--thâ Impire
Shtate Express. She must niver be late here.â

Hiram promised. At 2 P.M., when the Empire State Express was due in
two minutes, he dropped the crossing gates and stood by with the white
flag to wave her along. Three minutes passed, four, five--and still no
train. As a matter of fact, she had lost half an hour at an open draw
on the Harlem River in the morning, and was laboring mightily to
regain lost time in spite of her fast schedule.

Seven minutes late, and then Hiram heard a wild shriek a mile away and
saw the express coming. He darted into the shanty, grabbed a red flag,
and leaped out upon the track, waving it furiously. The engineer shut
off, threw over the reverse lever, gave her sand and the air; and the
mighty train stopped short, in a whirl of sand, cinders, and sparks,
brakes creaking and passengers pitchpoling everywhere.

âWhatâs the matter now?â roared the engineer, thrusting half his body
out of the cab and glaring down at Hiram.

âBe yeou thâ ingineer?â asked the flagman, peering at him with
suspicion.

âYes, yes! Whad-do-you want?â

âI want tâ know whutâs made ye so goldinged late? Cassidy says he

the Strand when I was at the head of a procession and you were on a

Some time ago Professor Brander Matthews went to dine at a certain
dramatic club in New York. Going to the club letter box he picked up
and perused a letter which seemed to be addressed to him. It was a
request from a tailor for the settlement of his little bill. As the
manâs name was quite strange to him he made a careful examination, and
finding that he had been mistaken, put the missive back into its
place. Immediately afterward he saw the real owner take possession of
it, walk into the reading-room, read it carefully, and tear it into
shreds. Then, assured of an audience, the man whose clothes were still
unpaid for, assumed the weary smile of an accomplished ladykiller and
remarked audibly, âPoor, silly, little girl!â

A street-car âmasherâ tried in every way to attract the attention of
the pretty young girl opposite him. Just as he had about given up, the
girl, entirely unconscious of what had been going on, happened to
glance in his direction. The âmasherâ immediately took fresh courage.

âItâs cold out to-day, isnât it?â he ventured.

The girl smiled and nodded assent, but had nothing to say.

âMy name is Specknoodle,â he volunteered.

âOh, I am so sorry,â she said sympathetically, as she left the car.

The friend produced two fives. âAbe,â he said, âyou are thinking of
going over to Brooklyn, buying a small stock of goods, renting a small
store, taking out all the fire-insurance that you can possibly get,
and then burning out. Do I win my bet?â

Andrew Carnegie tells a good story illustrating the canniness of the
Scot.

An Irish friend had insisted that a Scotchman should stay at his
house, instead of at a hotel, and kept him there for a month, playing
the host in detail, even to treating him to sundry visits to the
theater, paying the cab fares and the rest. When the visitor was
returning home, the Irishman saw him to the station, and they went
together to have a last cigar.

âNow, look here,â said the Scot, âIâll hae nae mair oâ this. Here
yeâve been keepinâ me at your hoose for a month, anâ payinâ for aâ the
amusements and cabs and so on--I tell you Iâll stanâ nae mair oâ it!
Weâll just hae a toss for this one!â

It is a well-established fact that the average school-teacher
experiences a great deal of difficulty when she attempts to enforce

progress of a reading exercise, âplease read the first sentence.â

It is not necessary that a lawyer should be eloquent to win verdicts,
but he must have the tact which turns an apparent defeat to his own
advantage. One of the most successful of verdict winners was Sir James
Scarlett. His skill in turning a failure into a success was wonderful.
In a breach-of-promise case the defendant, Scarlettâs client, was
alleged to have been cajoled into an engagement by the plaintiffâs
mother. She was a witness in behalf of her daughter, and completely
baffled Scarlett, who cross-examined her. But in his argument he
exhibited his tact by this happy stroke of advocacy: âYou saw,
gentlemen of the jury, that I was but a child in her hands. What must
my client have been?â

Toward the close of the exercises the superintendent called upon the

Once upon a time there was a young married man who had some slight
bickerings with the woman of his choice. These having occurred with
great frequency, he went to his father, who was older and much more
married.

âFather,â he said, âis it not meet that I should be the ringmaster in
my own wickiup? Or must I kowtow to the old lady?â

Whereat the old man smiled wisely and said:

âMy son, yonder are a hundred chickens and here a fine team of horses.
Do you place the feathered tribe on this wagon, hitch up the team, and
start out. Wherever you find a man and his wife living together, make
diligent investigation to find out who the commanding officer is, and
where it is the woman give her a chicken. If you find a man running a
house give him one of the horses.â

So the young man loaded up the fowls and started out upon his
pilgrimage of self-education. And when he had but seven chickens
left, he approached a habitation with his forlorn inquiry, to which
the man replied:

âIâm the ace-high cockalorum of this outfit.â

And the wife, without fear or favor, corroborated the statement. Then
the young man said:

âTake your choice of the horses. Either one you fancy is yours.â And
after the man had walked around the team several times and looked in
their mouths, he said, âWell, Iâll take the bay.â

Now, the wife didnât like bay horses, and she called John aside, and
after whispering in his ear she allowed him to return.

âI guess Iâll take the black horse,â he said.

âNot a bit of it,â said the pilgrim. âYouâll take a chicken.â

In the late financial stringency a clerk in one of the New York banks
was trying to explain to a stolid old Dutchman why the bank could not
pay cash to depositors as formerly, and was insisting that he be
satisfied with Clearing House checks. But the old man could not grasp
the situation, and finally the president of the bank was called upon
to enlighten the dissatisfied customer. After a detailed explanation
of the financial situation the president concluded, âNow, my good
man, you understand, donât you?â

âYes,â dubiously replied the Dutchman, âI tinks I understand. Itâs
just like this; ven my baby vakes up in der night und cries for milk,
I give her a milk ticket.â

Levinsky, despairing of his life, made an appointment with a famous
specialist. He was surprised to find fifteen or twenty people in the
waiting-room.

After a few minutes he leaned over to a gentleman near him and
whispered, âSay, mine frient, this must be a pretty goot doctor, ainât
he?â

âOne of the best,â the gentleman told him.

Levinsky seemed to be worrying over something.

âVell, say,â he whispered again, âhe must be pretty exbensive, then,
ainât he? Vat does he charge?â

The stranger was annoyed by Levinskyâs questions and answered rather
shortly: âFifty dollars for the first consultation and twenty-five
dollars for each visit thereafter.â

âMine Gott!â gasped Levinsky. âFifty tollars the first time und
twenty-five tollars each time afterwards!â

For several minutes he seemed undecided whether to go or to wait. âUnd
twenty-five tollars each time afterward,â he kept muttering. Finally,
just as he was called into the office, he was seized with a brilliant
inspiration. He rushed toward the doctor with outstretched hands.

âHello, doctor,â he said effusively. âVell, here I am again.â

He was a big, black, good-hearted, old negro, stranded near Boston,
and he had decided, after considerable âcogitation,â to work his way
back to, the South, where he would feel more at home. In Boston, in
Springfield, in Hartford, in New Haven, it was always the same. When
he rang a bell and asked for work and a bite to eat the answer
usually was, âIâm very sorry, but thereâs not a thing to be done here
to-day.â There were occasional exceptions, of course, or uncle could
never have got on, but the thing most to be counted upon was pleasing
politeness coupled with nothing else.

At last the old man left New York and then Philadelphia behind, and
one day found himself in Baltimore. His knowledge of geography was
_nil_, but he thought he ought soon to be getting into âde Souf,â and
with that hope at heart rang the bell of a fine house on Charles
Street. The door was opened by the host himself, who, after an
instantâs survey of the figure before him, blurted out:

âWhy, yoâ ---- black rascal! How dare yoâ ring this bell? Get off mah
steps this seconâ, befoâ I brek yoâ haid!â

ââDeed I will, boss; âdeed I will,â came the hurried answer. âI wuz
onây lookinâ fer a bite to eat, boss.â

âA bite to eat!â repeated the other. âAnâ donât yoâ know whar to go
for all yoâ want? Get yoâself round back, anâ theyâll feed yoâ
full--but cyart yoâ good-for-nuthinâ black carcass off these steps, I
say.â

And as uncle went around to the side door he raised his hands to
heaven, and with tears of rejoicing running down his furrowed cheeks,
said:

âBress de Lord! Iâs back agin among mah own folks!â

Former President Scott, of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad, was
greatly annoyed, when he first took hold of the road, by the claims
for horses and cattle killed by trains on their way through Kentucky.
It seemed as though it were not possible for a train to run north or
south through Kentucky without killing either a horse or a cow. And
every animal killed, however scrawny, scrubby, or miserable it may
have been before the accident, always figured in the claims
subsequently presented as of the best blood in Kentucky. âWell,â said
Scott one day, after examining a claim, âI donât know anything that
improves stock in Kentucky like crossing it with a locomotive.â

âBride and groom--100 to 1.â

Every one turned to view the newcomers, who had deposited themselves
vis-Ã -vis in No. 4. As if unconscious of any scrutiny, the young man
said, in a high, nasal voice:

âWell, do as you like about it; either increase the margin or let it
go. You didnât follow my advice in the first place, but if you want to

A Good Samaritan, passing an apartment-house in the small hours of the
morning, noticed a man leaning limply against the doorway.

âWhatâs the matter?â he asked. âDrunk?â

âYep.â

âDo you live in this house?â

âYep.â

âDo you want me to help you upstairs?â

âYep.â

With much difficulty he half dragged, half carried the drooping figure
up the stairway to the second floor.

âWhat floor do you live on?â he asked. âIs this it?â

âYep.â

Rather than face an irate wife who might, perhaps, take him for a
companion more at fault than her spouse, he opened the first door he
came to and pushed the limp figure in.

The good Samaritan groped his way downstairs again. As he was passing
through the vestibule he was able to make out the dim outlines of
another man, apparently in worse condition than the first one.

âWhatâs the matter?â he asked. âAre you drunk, too?â

âYep,â was the feeble reply.

âDo you live in this house, too?â

âYep.â

âShall I help you upstairs?â

âYep.â

Stopping on the second floor, where this man also said he lived, he
opened the door and pushed him in. As he again reached the front door
he discerned the shadow of a third man, evidently worse off than
either of the other two. He was about to approach him when the object
of his solicitude lurched out into the street and threw himself into
the arms of a passing policeman. âFor Heavenâs sake, offâcer,â he

A certain prosy preacher recently gave an endless discourse on the
prophets. First he dwelt at length on the minor prophets. At last he
finished them, and the congregation gave a sigh of relief. He took a
long breath and continued: âNow I shall proceed to the major
prophets.â

After the major prophets had received more than ample attention the
congregation gave another sigh of relief.

prophets, what about Jeremiah? Where is Jeremiahâs place?â

A little man, wedged into the middle of a car, suddenly thought of

Aunt Mahaly, an old negress with a worthless husband, was relating her
troubles to her minister. The usual condolences were offered by the
latter and remedies suggested, but at each one Aunt Mahaly shook a
doubting head--she had tried them all without avail.

The minister sighed and pondered, and at last had an inspiration. He
leaned to Aunt Mahaly, who brightened visibly.

âSisâ Mahaly,â he said, âhab you eber tried heapinâ coals er fire on

The gleam of hope faded from Aunt Mahalyâs face.

A barber in South Bend, having been out late the night before, had a
shaky hand the next morning and cut a patronâs cheek four times. After
each accident the barber said, as he sponged away the blood: âOh, dear
me, how careless!â

The patron took all these gashes in grave silence. But when the shave
was over he filled a glass at the water-cooler, took a mouthful of
water, and, with compressed lips, proceeded to shake his head from
side to side.

âWhat is the matter?â the barber asked. âYou ainât got the toothache,
have you?â

âNo,â said the customer; âI only wanted to see if my mouth would still
hold water without leaking.â

At one of the lectures by Professor George Kirchwey, dean of Columbia
Law College, New York, the students were uneasy. There was something
wrong in the air. Books were dropped, chairs were pushed along the
floor. There were various interruptions. The nerves of all were on
edge. The members of the class kept their eyes on the clock and
awaited the conclusion of the hour of the lecture. The clock beat
Professor Kirchwey by perhaps a minute, but at the expiration of the
schedule time the students started to their feet and prepared to
leave. âWait a minute,â objected Professor Kirchwey; âdonât go just
yet. I have a few more pearls to cast.â

Mrs. Flint _always_ demanded instant and unquestioning obedience from
her children. One afternoon a storm came up and she sent her son John
to close the trapdoor leading to the roof.

âBut mother--â said John.

âJohn, I told you to shut the trapdoor.â

âYes, but, Mother--â

âJohn, shut that trapdoor.â

âAll right, Mother, if you say so, but--â

âJohn!â

John slowly climbed the stairs and shut the trapdoor. The storm howled
and raged. Two hours later the family gathered for tea. When the meal
was half over Aunt Mary had not appeared, and Mrs. Flint started an
investigation. She did not have to ask many questions; John answered
the first one:

âPlease, Mother, she is up on the roof.â

A lady from South America possessed of a decidedly quick temper came
to New York with a very incomplete knowledge of the English language.
At her hotel she rang for the chambermaid. But a waiter came instead.
Having ascertained that the name of the chambermaid was Susan, the
lady marshaled her meager knowledge of English in a desperate effort
to make the waiter understand that he should call the chambermaid.
What she said to him, however, was:

âCall me Susan!â

The waiter leaned against the wall much alarmed.

âCall me Susan!â shouted the South American.

The waiter became appalled.

âCall me Susan!â roared the lady, her eyes flashing furiously.

The reputed affinity between the Southern negro and unguarded poultry
is the subject of a story told by Senator Bacon, of Georgia. An old
colored man, notorious for his evil ways, after attending a revival
meeting, desired to lead a better life. At a later meeting he was
called up to be questioned.

âWell, Rastus,â said the revivalist, âI hope you are now trying to
live a Christian life in accordance with the rules of the Church. Have
you been stealing any chickens lately?â

âNo, sah! I ainât stole no chicken ob late.â

âAny turkeys or pigs?â

Rastus, grieved, replied: âNo, sah!â

âI am very glad to hear that you have been doing better lately,â
replied the evangelist. âContinue to lead a holy and Christian life,
Rastus.â

After the meeting was over, Rastus drew a long breath of relief, and
turning to his wife exclaimed:

âMandy, if heâd said ducks Iâd been a lost nigger, suah!â

while a fair worker, is yet an individual of pronounced eccentricity.

One day a wire basket fell off the top of the clerkâs desk and

A few years ago a dear old lady, who formerly lived in Ipswich, and

which necessitated a nightâs ride in a sleeping car. Being subject to
attacks of acute indigestion, she took the precaution to place a few

During the night, pains, either real or imaginary, warned her of

secured it, proceeded to put one of the leaves where it would do the
most good, and immediately felt comforted and enjoyed a refreshing
sleep until morning.

Upon removing the plaster, what was her astonishment to find that it
was a $10 bank note that had brought such speedy relief.

A minister of a fashionable church had always left the greeting of
strangers to be attended to by the ushers until he read some newspaper
articles in reference to the matter.

âSuppose a representative should visit our church,â said his wife.
âWouldnât it be awful?â

âIt would,â the minister admitted.

The following Sunday evening he noticed a plainly dressed woman in one
of the free pews. She sat alone and was clearly not a member of the
flock. After the benediction the minister hastened and intercepted her
at the door.

âHow do you do?â he said, offering his hand. âI am very glad to have
you with us.â

The editor of a rural newspaper determined to adopt the idea of
posting bulletins on a bulletin board for all important events that
happened in the town. Soon afterward he was told one morning by the
local physician that Deacon Jones was seriously ill. The deacon was a
man of some distinction in the community, so the editor posted a
series of bulletins as follows:

10 A. M.--Deacon Jones no better.

11 A. M.--Deacon Jones has relapse.

12.30 P. M.--Deacon Jones weaker. Pulse failing.

1 P. M.--Deacon Jones has slight rally.

3.10 P. M.--Deacon Jones has died and gone to heaven.

Later in the afternoon a traveling salesman happened by, stopped to
read the bulletins, and going to the bulletin board, made another
report concerning the deceased. It was:

4.10 P. M.--Great excitement in heaven. Deacon Jones has not yet
arrived.

A group of drummers were trading yarns on the subject of hospitality,
when one, a little Virginian with humorous eyes and a delightful
drawl, took up his parable thus:

âI was down in Louisiana last month, travelinâ âcross country with a
friend, when we kinder got lost in a mighty lonesome sort of road just
about dark. We rode along a right good piece after sundown, and when
we saw a light ahead, I tell you it looked first-rate. We drove up to
the light, finding âtwas a house, and when I hollered like a lost calf
the man came out and we asked him to take us in for the night. He
looked at us mighty hard, then said:

ââWal, I reckon I kin stand it if you kin.â

âSo we went in and found âtwas only a two-room shanty, just swarminâ
with children. He had six, from four to eleven years old; as there
didnât seem to be but one bed, me anâ Stony wondered what in thunder
would become of us.

âThey gave us supper, good hog and hominy, the best they had, and then
the old woman put the two youngest kids to bed. They went straight to
sleep. Then she took those out, laid them over in the corner, put the
next two to bed, and so on.

âAfter all the children were asleep on the floor the old folk went in
the other room and told us we could go to bed if we wanted to, and
beinâ powerful tired out, we did.

âWell, sir, the next morning when we woke up we were lying over in the
corner with the kids, and the old man and the old woman had the bed.â

As every one knows, the great Von Moltke never wasted words and
despised anything that approached garrulity in others. German army
officers are fond of telling an anecdote illustrative of this
peculiarity:

Von Moltke was leaving Berlin on a railway journey. Just before the
train pulled out of the station a captain of hussars entered the
generalâs compartment and, recognizing him, saluted with âGuten
Morgen, Excellenz!â

Two hours later the train slowed up at a way station. The captain

A gentleman gave a large dinner party in Dublin once and invited Mr.
OâConnor, one of the wittiest men in the Emerald Isle, to amuse and
divert his guests. Mr. OâConnor accepted the invitation with pleasure.
But from the beginning to the end of dinner he preserved a solemn and
serious face. The host thought this very strange, and just before
rising from the table remarked to him jestingly, âWhy, OâConnor, old
fellow, I donât believe the biggest fool in Ireland could make you
laugh to-night.â Whereupon his guest answered in a solemn tone,
speaking his first word that evening, âTry.â

Governor Guild of Massachusetts, who served in the Spanish War, tells
a story of a New York regiment, many of whose members were recruited
on the East Side. They were spoiling for a fight, and it became
necessary to post a sentry to preserve order.

A big husky Bowery recruit, of pugilistic propensities, was put on
guard outside, and given special orders to see that quiet reigned, and
above all things, if trouble came his way, not to lose possession of
his rifle.

Soon a general row began, growing in proportions as the minutes
passed. The soldier walked his post nervously, without interrupting,
until the corporal of the guard appeared on the scene with
reenforcements.

âWhy didnât you stop this row?â shouted the corporal.

The sentry, balancing his rifle on his shoulder, raised his arms to
the correct boxing position, and replied:

âSure, phwat could I do wid this gun in me hands!â

A New Jersey man recently reached the conclusion that his
eight-year-old boy is a trifle too bright.

At dinner one evening the father had been entertaining a number of
friends from Philadelphia with a funny story. This was at dessert. The
youngster had been very quiet throughout the previous courses; but
here he arose to the occasion in fine style.

When the laughter induced by his fatherâs humor had ceased, the boy,
with a fine affectation of delight, said:

Not long ago a man was charged with shooting a number of pigeons, the
property of a farmer. In giving his evidence the farmer was
exceedingly careful, even nervous, and the solicitor for the defense
endeavored to frighten him. âNow,â he remarked, âare you prepared to
swear that this man shot your pigeons?â âI didnât say he did shoot
âem,â was the reply. âI said I suspected him oâ doing it.â âAh! now

caught him on my land wiâ a gun. Secondly, I heerd a gun go off anâ
saw some pigeons fall. Thirdly, I found four oâ my pigeons in his

A red-faced man was holding the attention of a little group with some
wonderful recitals.

âThe most exciting chase I ever had,â he said, âhappened a few years
ago in Russia. One night, when sleighing about ten miles from my
destination I discovered, to my intense horror, that I was being
followed by a pack of wolves. I fired blindly into the pack, killing
one of the brutes, and to my delight saw the others stop to devour it.
After doing this, however, they still came on. I kept on repeating the
dose, with the same result, and each occasion gave me an opportunity
to whip up my horse. Finally there was only one wolf left, yet on it
came, with its fierce eyes glowing in anticipation of a good, hot
supper.â

Here the man who had been sitting in the corner burst forth into a fit
of laughter.

âWhy, man,â said he, âby your way of reckoning that last wolf must
have had the rest of the pack inside him!â

âAh!â said the red-faced man without a tremor, ânow I remember, it did
wobble a bit.â

A traveling man stopped at an Indiana hotel. The proprietor told him
he had not a room in the house. The man said he must have a room.
Finally the proprietor told him there was a room, a little room
separated by a thin partition from a nervous man who had lived in the
house for ten years.

âHe is so nervous,â said the landlord, âI donât dare put any one in
that room. The least noise might give him a nervous spell that would
endanger his life.â

âOh, give me a room,â said the traveler. âIâll be so quiet heâll not

to disrobe. He took off one article of clothing after another as
quietly as a burglar. At last he came to his shoes. He unlaced a shoe
and dropped it.

The shoe fell to the floor with a great noise. The offending traveler,
horrified at what he had done, waited to hear from the nervous man.
Not a sound. He took off the second shoe and placed it noiselessly
upon the floor; then in absolute silence finished undressing and
crawled between the sheets.

Half an hour went by. He had dropped into a doze when there came a
tremendous knocking on the partition.

matter?â he asked.

There was once an Irishman, who sought employment as a diver, bringing
with him his native enthusiasm and a certain amount of experience.
Although he had never been beneath the water, he had crossed an ocean
of one variety and swallowed nearly an ocean of another. But he had
the Hibernian smile, which is convincing, and the firm chanced to need
a new man. And so on the following Monday morning Pat hid his smile
for the first time in a diving helmet.

Now, the job upon which the crew to which Pat had attached himself was
working in comparatively shallow water, and Pat was provided with a
pick and told to use it on a ledge below in a manner with which he was
already familiar.

Down he went with his pick, and for about fifteen minutes nothing was
heard from him. Then came a strong, determined, deliberate pull on the
signal rope, indicating that Pat had a very decided wish to come to
the top. The assistants pulled him hastily to the raft and removed his
helmet.

said politely: âI have enjoyed your sermon this morning. I welcomed it
as I would an old friend. I have a book in my library that contains
every word of it.â âImpossible, sir,â replied the rector, indignantly.
âNot at all. I assure you it is true,â said Twain. âThen I shall
trouble you to send me that book,â rejoined the rector with dignity.
The next morning Dr. Doane received, with Mark Twainâs compliments, a

The friend having facetiously warned Clemens that the painter was a

Whistler should the latter attempt âany funny business.â Furthermore,
Twain determined to anticipate Whistler, if possible.

So, when the two had been introduced, which event took place in
Whistlerâs studio, Clemens, assuming an air of hopeless stupidity,
approached a just-completed painting, and said:

âNot at all bad, Mr. Whistler, not at all bad. Only,â he added,
reflectively, with a motion as if to rub out a cloud effect, âif I
were you Iâd do away with that cloud.â

âGreat Heavens, sir!â exclaimed Whistler, almost beside himself. âDo
be careful not to touch that; the paint is not yet dry!â

âOh, I donât mind that,â responded Twain, with an air of perfect
nonchalance; âI am wearing gloves.â

Washington. âYou tâell-a with my Gar-r-ribaldi?â he hissed between his

A woman who traveled a great deal in the West was known as the most
inveterate âkickerâ a certain hotel had ever known.

One evening after she had been served with dessert this lady, who was
always complaining, asked the waiter why the dish served her was
called âice-cream pudding.â

âIf you donât like it, maâam, Iâll bring you something else,â
suggested the polite negro.

âOh, itâs very nice,â responded the lady. âWhat I object to is that it
should be called ice-cream pudding. Itâs wrongly named. There should
be ice cream served with it.â

âYes, maâam,â replied the waiter, âbut thatâs jest our name for it.
Lots oâ dishes that way. Dey donât bring you a cottage with cottage
pudding, you know.â

During a certain cruise the first mate of a ship got to drinking to
excess and was intoxicated for several days. One day, after having
come out of this state, he examined the log book to see what had
passed during his period of semi-forgetfulness. He was horrified to
find entered in the book for the three days consecutively, âThe first
mate is drunk to-day.â He did not want this to stand as it would
hardly be a good recommendation for him to the ship owners and asked
the captain to remove the entries.

The captain replied, âIt is the truth, is it not?â âYes, but--â
replied the mate. The captain interrupted him, âIf it is the truth,
the truth must stand. It is written in ink and can not be removed
without injuring the book.â

A short time afterward the captain was taken ill and remained so for a
week, and it devolved upon the mate to keep the log book. The captain
on recovering from his illness got the book to examine it to see how
the mate had done his duty. Imagine his consternation when he read in
each of the seven daysâ entries, âThe captain is sober to-day.â

The captain immediately called the mate and indignantly questioned him
in regard to these entries. The mate replied, âIt is the truth, is it
not?â âYes, but--â replied the captain. The mate interrupted him, âIf
it is the truth, the truth must stand, must it not? I have your word
that the writing in ink can not be erased.â

âIt was the first week of his honeymoon,â said the hotel barber, âand
he came in and sat down near the door to wait his turn. I yelled
âNextâ at him two or three times when my chair was vacant, but he was
dreaming and didnât hear me. Finally I touched him on the shoulder and
told him I was ready for him.

ââWhat do you want me to do?â he asked.

ââWhy, get in the chair if you want anything,â I replied. âThis is a
barber shop.â

ââOh, yes,â he said, and then he got into the chair. He leaned back,
so I let the chair down and shaved him. He didnât have a word to say.
When I finished him up he got out of the chair and took the check over
to the cashier. He paid and started out. When halfway through the door
he stopped.

ââSay,â he said to me, âwhat did you do to me?â

ââI shaved you,â I said.

ââDarn the luck,â he replied, âI wanted a haircut.ââ

I--â

âThatâs just what I said to my boss,â interrupted the agent. âI told
him, when he suggested your name to me, that it was a relief to call
on a man who did not expect to be praised and flattered to his face
all the time. I tell you, Mr. Grump, this city has mighty few men such
as you. Nine men out of ten are simply dying to have some one tell
them how great they are, but you are above such weakness. Any one can
see that at a glance. Iâm glad of it. Itâs helpful to me to meet a
man who rises superior to the petty tactics of the average solicitor.
Itâs a real and lasting benefit, and an instructive experience.â

bustle and excitement of the London street, the hoi polloi, the
Billingsgate and the din and rattle were becoming almost unbearable
when they came in sight of Westminster Abbey. Just as they did so,
the chimes burst forth in joyous melody, and he said to Casey, âIsnât
it sublime? Isnât it glorious to hear those chimes pealing and doesnât
it inspire one with renewed vigor?â Casey leaned over, with hand to
his ear, and said, âYouâll have to speak a little louder, Riley; I
canât hear you.â Riley continued, âThose magnificent chimes. Do you
not hear them pealing? Do they not imbue you with a feeling of almost
reverence? Do they not awaken tender memories of the past?â Casey
again leaned forward and said, âI canât hear you. Youâll have to speak
louder.â Riley got as close to him as possible and said, âDo you not
hear the melodious pealing of the chimes? Do they not recall the
salutation of old Trinity on a Sabbath morning? Do they not take you
back into the dim vistas of the past when the world was young, and
touch your heart with a feeling of pathos?â Casey put his mouth close

them all out of the bag, but I filled it again from the stone-heap

Mr. George Broadhurst, author of the play, âThe Man of the Hour,â is
an Englishman, and recently made a visit to his native country. After
having lived a week at one of the large hotels in London, he was
surprised on the evening of his departure, although at a very late
hour, to see an endless procession of waiters, maids, porters, and
pages come forward with the expectant smile and empty hand. When each
and all had been well bestowed, even boots and under-boots and then
another boots, he dashed for the four-wheeler that was to carry him
safely away.

Settling himself with a sigh of relief, he was about to be off when a
page popped his head into the window and breathlessly exclaimed:

âI beg pardon, sir, but the night-lift man says heâs waiting for a
message from you, sir.â

âA message from me?â

âYes, sir; he says he cawnât go to sleep without a message from you,
sir.â

âReally, he canât go to sleep without a message from me?â

âNo, sir.â

âHow touching. Then tell him, âPleasant dreams.ââ

Tennysonâs customary manner toward women was one of grave and stately

and the two guests who were in the house.

âThere are three other ladies who oppose it,â Sir Edward answered.

Mr. Brown, a Kansas gentleman, is the proprietor of a boarding-house.
Around his table at a recent dinner sat his wife, Mrs. Brown; the
village milliner, Mrs. Andrews; Mr. Black, the baker; Mr. Jordan, a
carpenter; and Mr. Hadley, a flour, feed, and lumber merchant. Mr.
Brown took a ten-dollar bill out of his pocketbook and handed it to
Mrs. Brown, with the remark that there was ten dollars toward the
twenty he had promised her. Mrs. Brown handed the bill to Mrs.
Andrews, the milliner, saying, âThat pays for my new bonnet.â Mrs.
Andrews, in turn, passed it on to Mr. Jordan, remarking that it would
pay for the carpentry work he had done for her. Mr. Jordan handed it
to Mr. Hadley, requesting his receipted bill for flour, feed, and
lumber. Mr. Hadley gave the bill back to Mr. Brown, saying, âThat pays
ten dollars on my board.â Mr. Brown again passed it to Mrs. Brown,
remarking that he had now paid her the twenty dollars he had promised
her. She, in turn, paid it to Mr. Black to settle her bread and pastry
account. Mr. Black handed it to Mr. Hadley, asking credit for the
amount on his flour bill, Mr. Hadley again returning it to Mr. Brown,
with the remark that it settled for that monthâs board; whereupon
Brown put it back into his pocketbook, observing that he had not
supposed a greenback would go so far.

A doctor came up to a patient in an insane asylum, slapped him on the
back, and said: âWell, old man, youâre all right, you can run along
and write your folks that youâll be back home in two weeks as good as
new.â The patient went off gaily to write his letter. He had it
finished and sealed, but when he was licking the stamp it slipped
through his fingers to the floor, lighted on the back of a cockroach
that was passing and stuck. The patient hadnât seen the
cockroach--what he did see was his escaped postage stamp zig-zagging
aimlessly across the floor to the baseboard, wavering up over the
baseboard and following a crooked track up the wall and across the
ceiling. In depressed silence he tore up the letter and dropped the
pieces on the floor. âTwo weeks! Hell!â he said. âI wonât be out of
here in three years.â

As several travelers got into the station âbus one of the men (who was
quite a portly fellow) noticed that a certain young woman had a grip
exactly like his, but that it was placed with the rest of the luggage,
on top. Thinking there might be some mistake made he kept his inside
and placed it at his feet. He was soon engrossed in his paper, and did
not notice the young woman reach over and draw the grip close to her
side. Being of a humorous turn of mind he waited until she was
occupied with a book and then pulled the grip to its former position,
the rest of the travelers looking on with amused expressions.

In turning over a leaf she looked down and suddenly became aware of
the removal of the grip. She was quite indignant, and with some force
in her voice and manner said, âThat is _mine_!â and jerked it back
close to her feet.

said quietly: âHadnât you better stay here now?â

in connection with the last commencement day. A clever girl had taken
one of the principal prizes. At the close of the exercises her friends
crowded about her to offer congratulations.

âWerenât you awfully afraid you wouldnât get it, Hattie?â asked one,

âOh, no!â cheerily exclaimed Hattie. âBecause I knew when it came to
English composition I had âem all skinned.â

Yours truly, Mark Twain.â

Taking a friend through the building he pointed out with particular

An aged, gray-haired and very wrinkled old woman, arrayed in the
outlandish calico costume of the mountains, was summoned as a witness
in court to tell what she knew about a fight in her house. She took
the witness-stand with evidences of backwardness and proverbial
Bourbon verdancy. The Judge asked her in a kindly voice what took
place. She insisted it did not amount to much, but the Judge by his
persistency finally got her to tell the story of the bloody fracas.

âNow, I tell ye, Jedge, it didnât amount to nuthnâ. The fust I knowed
about it was when Bill Saunder called Tom Smith a liar, en Tom knocked
him down with a stick oâ wood. One oâ Billâs friends then cut Tom with
a knife, slicinâ a big chunk out oâ him. Then Sam Jones, who was a

three or four others got cut right smart by somebody. That nachly

A New England school-teacher recited âThe Landing of the Pilgrimsâ to
her pupils, then asked each of them to draw from their imagination a
picture of Plymouth Rock. One little fellow hesitated and then raised
his hand. âWell, Willie, what is it?â asked the teacher. âPlease
teacher, do you want us to draw a hen or a rooster?â

An English gentleman had sent a private note to a marquis, on a
personal matter, by hand, and on the return of the man questioned him
as to his reception. âAh, sir,â said the man, âthereâs no use writing
him any letter, he canât see to read them. Heâs blind.â

âBlind!â

âYes, sir. He asked me twice where my hat was, and I had it on my head
all the time.â

A magician was performing in a Kentucky town, and during the evening
announced that in his next trick he would need a pint flask of whisky.
No move was made to supply the liquor. âPerhaps you did not understand
me. Will some gentleman kindly loan me a pint flask of whisky?â Then a
lank man in the rear of the hall arose. âMistah,â said he, âwill a
quart flask do?â âJust as well, sir,â replied the magician, and every
gentleman in the hall arose with flask extended.

âPhoebe,â said a mistress in reproof to her colored servant whom she
found smoking a short pipe after having repeatedly threatened to
discharge her if again caught in the act, âif you wonât stop that bad
habit for any other reason do so because it is right. You are a good
church member--and, donât you know that smoking makes the breath
unpleasant, and that nothing unclean can enter Heaven?â ââDeed,
missie, I does,â said the woman, âbut bressâ yoâ heart, when I go to
Heaben Iâll leave my bref behinâ.â

It was the custom of a certain deacon, when dining at the home of one
of his best friends, to drink a glass of milk, as a prelude to his
dinner. One day when the minister was scheduled to appear, instead of
the rich, foamy glass of milk, his friend placed beside his plate a
glass of milk punch. After the blessing, the deacon seized his glass
and drank to the last drop, and then exclaimed as he closed his eyes
and smacked his lips, â_Oh_, what a cow!â

Dean Hole of Rochester, England, told of a very innocent and obliging
curate who went to a Yorkshire parish where many of the parishioners
bred horses and sometimes raced them. A few Sundays after his arrival
he was asked to invite the prayers of the congregation for Lucy Grey.
He did so. They prayed for three Sundays for her. On the fourth, the
church clerk told the curate that he need not do it any more. âWhy,â
he asked, âis she dead?â âNo,â said the clerk, âsheâs won the
steeplechase.â

The late Richard Henry Stoddard while endeavoring to procure an
impromptu luncheon for a number of his friends after his wife and the
servants had retired, found a box of sardines. His vigorous remarks,
inspired by the sardine-canâs objections to the âopen sesameâ of a
dull jack-knife, attracted the attention of Mrs. Stoddard on the floor
above.

âWhat _are_ you doing?â she called down.

âOpening a can of sardines.â

âWith what?â

âA dashed old jack-knife,â cried the exasperated poet; âwhat did you
think I was opening it with?â

âWell, dear,â she answered, âI didnât think you were opening it with
prayer.â

Colored people are proverbially fond of funerals, and Mrs. Walkerâs
cook was trying to make her mistress realize what she had missed by
not attending the funeral of a prominent citizen of their village.

âMisâ Fanny,â she said, âyou sholy orto hev been thar. I ainâ nevvah

William Bourke Cochran took his seat in Congress on the day that the
House went into turmoil over the special report on post-office
affairs. âI suppose it looks like old times to you, Cochran,â said a
friend, who, with others, had crowded around to welcome him back. Just
then such epithets as âcoward,â âknave,â âscoundrel,â and âliar,â
hurtled across the chamber. âWell, I canât say it looks much like old
times,â replied Cochran, âtoo many new faces for that. But it
certainly sounds like old times.â

This happened in Scotland: The last edition of the newspapers had been

Tolstoy told Isabel Habgard, who has translated many of his books, a
good story of one of his ancestors, an army officer, who was an
excellent mimic. One day he was impersonating the Emperor Paul to a
group of his friends, when Paul himself entered, and for some moments
looked on, unperceived, at the antics of the young man. Tolstoy
finally turned, and beholding the emperor, bowed his head and was
silent. âGo on, sir,â said Paul; âcontinue the performance.â The young
man hesitated a moment, and then, folding his arms and imitating every
gesture and intonation of his sovereign, he said: âTolstoy, you
deserve to be degraded, but I remember the thoughtlessness of youth,
and you are pardoned.â The czar smiling, said, âWell, be it so.â

When President Nicholas Murray Butler was at college, certain freshmen
of his time made no scruple of stealing a pail of milk which a
dairyman daily placed outside the door of Mr. Butlerâs room while the
occupant was in class. In order to foil the boys, Mr. Butler printed a
sign in big letters, âI have poisoned this milk with arsenic.â Upon
his return he found the milk intact, but added to the notice were
these words: âSo have we.â

There is an amusing story told of a clergyman, who, upon one of his
trips through the West, observed that almost every man he met and
spoke with used profanity. Finally he found one man who talked to him
for twenty minutes without using an oath. The clergyman shook hands
with him at parting and said: âYou donât know how glad I am to have a
chance to have a talk with a man like you. You are the first man I
have met for three days who could talk for five minutes without
swearing.â The stranger, shocked, instantly and innocently ejaculated:
âWell, Iâll be d----d!â

The other day, while shopping, a lady accidentally picked up another
ladyâs umbrella from the counter, and had the mistake pointed out to
her in a rather frigid manner. She returned the umbrella with
apologies, and then remembered that she had no umbrella with her.

As it had begun to rain, she bought one, as well as one for a birthday
present for a friend. With the two umbrellas in her hand, she boarded
a car and, as luck would have it, sat down opposite the lady whose
umbrella she had picked up earlier in the store. As the latter swept
out of the car she smiled again frigidly, and remarked to the lady of
the umbrellas, âI see you have had a successful day.â

A university of Illinois professor is very popular among the students.
He was entertaining a group of them at his residence one night. Taking
down a magnificent sword that hung over the fireplace, he brandished
it about, exclaiming, âNever will I forget the day I drew this blade
for the first time.â âWhere did you draw it, sir?â an awe-struck

midst of his flattering utterances his mother, who was somewhat deaf,
piped up from the other end of the table: âYou neednât be praisinâ of

Of late years the House of Commons has seen some lively times. Many of
them have been brought about by the irascible but delightful Irish
member, Dr. Tanner. On one occasion, when he had been indulging rather
freely and his ever ready tongue being loosened, he met Sir Ellis
Ashmead Bartlett in the lobby, and taking him to one side he said, in
the greatest confidence, and without the slightest tinge of anger, but
with a world of meaning: âBartlett, you are a fool.â âYou are drunk,â
retorted the knight. âThatâs all right,â replied Dr. Tanner.
âTo-morrow I shall be sober, but you will still be a fool.â

An old negro living in Carrollton was taken ill recently, and called
in a physician of his race to prescribe for him. But the old man did
not seem to be getting any better, and finally a white physician was
called. Soon after arriving Dr. S---- felt the darkyâs pulse for a
moment, and then examined his tongue. âDid your other doctor take your
temperature?â he asked. âI donât know, sah,â he answered, feebly; âI
haint missed nuthinâ but mah watch yit, boss.â

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
