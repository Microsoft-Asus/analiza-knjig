âN.B.â


An English friend of ours called many years ago at Inverness Post
Office for some letters awaiting him there. They were addressed to
the Poste Restante, âInverness, N.B.â In handing him the letters, an
elderly lady who then graced the postal staff remarked: âYou micht tell
your freenâs that âN.B.â is quite superfluous. Hoo wad they like us
to write âLondon, S.B.â? _And we donât think that muckle oâ London up
here._â Now, whether we use âN.B.â as meaning âNorth Britain,â or âNota
Bene,â we shall leave you to guess!

[Illustration]

Unless we are mistaken, we have seen more than once in English
papers a suggestion that the Scots are a race devoid of humour. âHe
joked wiâ deeficultyâ is, we believe, a reference to a Scotsman. âA
surgical----.â But no, we shall not repeat _that_! Oddly enough, the
pages of MR. PUNCH, true mirror of our national characteristics,
yield an abundant harvest of Scottish humour. Have we not already in
this same series made merry with âMr. Punch in the Highlandsâ? And we
are now to laugh with him again at this banquet of Scottish humour,
which by no means exhausts his store. We have already heard that some
seventy-five per cent. of the jokes appearing in _Punch_ contributed
by those not on the permanent staff come from Scotsmen; so it is a
reasonable assumption that the bulk of the anecdotes in the present
collection have originated north of the border, even when they tell
against the Scot; for it is not the least of his good points that Sandy
is able to appreciate a story that does not present him in the most
favourable light. No humour in Scotland! Here is MR. PUNCHâs reply!

Let this be noted by the Southerner: there is much confusion as to the
Highlander and the Lowlander. Here is not the place, even did space
allow, to attempt a definition of the difference between the two races
which Sir Walter Scott typifies in Rob Roy and in Bailie Nicol Jarvie.
In âMr. Punch in the Highlandsâ we have something of the humour of the
one; here we have a good deal of the humour of the other.

Of course a portion of the present book would be properly described
as âthe Scot through English glasses,â and in this respect it is none
the less valuable, being the next best thing to that for which Burns
sighed--

  âO wad some power the giftie gie us,
  To see ourselâs as others see us!
  It wad frae monie a blunder free us,
      And foolish notion.â

MR. PUNCH has striven to leave the Scot with no illusions as to the
characteristics he presents to his fellow Britons. We may gather from
these pages that MR. PUNCH, as spokesman for John Bull, has detected
in Sandy an occasional affection for that whisky which he produces
so industriously--and chiefly for English consumption--and that he
has noted in him a certain inclination âto keep the Sabbath day--and
everything else he can lay his hands on.â Who shall say that MR. PUNCH
has been mistaken? But we are not here to moralise; mirth is our
motive; and if the fun be good--as none will deny who fingers these
pages--enough is said.

This, at least, we may add: No artist who has ever been on MR. PUNCHâs
staff has made anything like so much of the dry, pawky humour that
obtains north of the Tweed as did Charles Keene. More than fifty per
cent. of MR. PUNCHâs illustrations of Scottish humour come from his
pencil; and he is ahead of his confrÃ¨res not only in quantity but in
quality--none of them has beaten him in the pictorial representation of
Scottish character. The shrewd, dour faces of some of his Scotsmen are
inimitable.

OLD SCOTS SLANG.--In an old Scots Act of Parliament âanent the
punishment of drunkardsâ a clause adjudges all persons âconvictâ of
drunkenness, or tavern-haunting, âfor the first faultâ to a fine of
Â£3, âor in case of inability or refusal, to be put in jogges or jayle
for the space of six hours.â What was âjogges,â as distinguished from
âjayleâ? Possibly a somewhat milder place of detention for the rather,
than that appointed for the very, drunken. If so, âjogges,â in the
lapse of time, we may suppose, having lost its distinctive sense, came
to be regarded as simply a synonym of âjayle,â and, as such, now passes
current in the Peopleâs English (not to say the Queenâs) abbreviated
into the contraction âjug.â Thus imprisonment for a state of too much
beer might be described as jug for jug.

Growth of Thistles received the Royal Assent_)

  Whatâs this? Forbid the growth oâ thristles,

  The hair upon ma head it bristles,
    At sic an awfuâ waste oâ power!

  âTis idle wark, as time will show,
    To root the bonny plant frae ground;
  For Nature still gars thristles grow
    Where canny Scots are to be found.

  What soil so puir but it can keep
    A thristle green amang its stanes?
  What land so bare a Scotsman deep
    Canna pick something aff its banes?

  As weel keep bees frae honey-pots,
    Keep cats frae cream, or bairns frae tarts,
  As thristles and their brither Scots
    Frae lands whaur goud is found iâ quartz.

THE LUNNON TWANG

  Iâve heard a Frenchman wag his tongue
    Wiâ unco din anâ rattle,
  Anâ, âfaith, my vera lugs hae sung
    Wiâ listeninâ tae his prattle;
  But French is no the worst of aâ
    In point oâ noise anâ clang, man;
  Thereâs ane that beats it far awaâ,
    And thatâs the Lunnon twang, man.

  You wadna think, within this land,
    That folk could talk sae queerly,
  But, sure as death, tae understand
    The callants beats me fairly.
  Anâ, âfaith, âtis little gude their schules
    Can teach them, as yeâll see, man,
  For--wad ye credit it?--the fules
    Can scarcely follow _me_, man.

  Anâ yet, tae gie the deils their due,
    (Anâ little praise theyâre worth, man,)
  They seem tae ken, I kenna hoo,
    That I come frae the Nor-r-th, man!
  They maun be clever, for ye ken
    Thereâs nought tae tell the chiefs, man:
  Iâm jist like aâ the ither men
    That hail frae Galashiels, man.

  But oh! Iâm fain tae see again
    The bonny hills anâ heather!
  Twa days, and neâer a drap oâ rain--
    Sic awfu, drouthy weather!
  But eh! I doubt the Gala boys
    Will laugh when hame I gang, man,

THE EGREGIOUS ENGLISHMAN

  A plague on yon Depairtment, Jeames!
    It maun be aye appearinâ
  Wiâ sic a host oâ daft-like schemes,
    Forever interferinâ.
  âTis past a joke when feckless fouk
    Awaâ in Lunnon ettle
  Wiâ aâ this fuss tae talk tae us,
    The Schule Board oâ Kingskettle.

  Iâll tell ye hoo it comes tae pass--
    The facts are easy stated:
  They takâ inspectors frae a class
    No richtly eddicated,
  Anâ when the fules inspect oor schules,
    Iâll swear upon my life, Jeames,
  Thereâs no a man can unnerstanâ

  Anâ whaurâs the cure? The thing tae dae
    Tae pit them on their mettle
  Wad be tae raise inspectors tae
    The staundard oâ Kingskettle;
  But eh! I fear frae what I hear
    Thae fouk in Lunnon toun, Jeames,
  Are bent the noo on findinâ hoo

  Theyâre sending doun a Southron loon

A SECOND VISIT TO SCOTLAND

(_Being an additional Chapter to âThe Tour in the Hebridesâ_)

âSir,â said Dr. Johnson, âlet us take a walk down Princes Street.â

Finding the great man in so excellent a humour, I seized upon the
opportunity to put to him many interesting questions.

âSir,â said I, âpray what do you think of Edinburgh?â

âI think, sir,â replied the Doctor, âthat its name is most appropriate.â

âSir,â I continued, in a fever of anticipation, âI shall be very much
obliged to you if you will explain your meaning in greater detail.â

[Illustration: âTHE BILLS OF MORTALITYâ

_Kirk Elder (after a look at his morning paper)._ âPoor McStagger deid!
Etâs vera sad to thenk oâ the great number oâ destengweshed men thatâs
lately been taâen! âDeed--I no feel vera weel--mysel!â]

[Illustration: A MERE DETAIL

_Friend of the Family._ âWeel, Mrs. MâGlasgie, and howâs your daughter
doinâ, the one that was married a while ago?â

_Mrs. MâGlasgie._ âOh, varra weel, thank ye, Mr. Brown, varra weel,
indeed! She canna abide her man. But then, ye ken, thereâs aye a
something!!â]

[Illustration: A YOUNG HUMANITARIAN

âOh, mamma, mamma, couldnât you interfere? Thereâs a horrid man
squeezing something under his arm, and he _is_ hurting it so!â]

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, I am sorry that my meaning should require
explanation. I say that the name Edinburgh is appropriate, because I
find the city primitive and beautiful. Adam and Eve would, doubtless,
have held it in high consideration had they had the advantage of its
possession. In short, sir, they would have called it the town of
their Eden, or Edinburgh.

_Mr. Boswell._ A pun, sir!

âIt was a pun, sir!â cried the Doctor, very angrily, and I hastened to
change the subject.

âI am surprised to find, sir,â said I, âthat Her Majesty does not
reside at Edinburgh. Do you not think, sir, that she might use her
Scottish Palace at Christmas time?â

âNo, sir, I do not think so,â replied the Doctor, âand I can find no
reason for your surprise.â

âIndeed, sir!â

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, were Her Most Gracious Majesty to dwell at
Edinburgh at Christmas time, she would be put to great inconvenience.
Her Most Gracious Majesty exhibits excellent sense in selecting
Balmoral for her residence.

_Mr. Boswell._ Sir, I trust you do not call in question my loyalty to
the House of Brunswick?

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, I do not; I only question your wisdom.

[Illustration: CAPACITY!

_First Traveller (proffering his mull)._ âTak a pench?â

_Second Traveller._ âNa, âm obleeged tâye--ah dinna takât.â

_First Traveller._ âMan!--thatâs a pety!--yeâve gr-r-raund
accaummodation forât!â]

_Mr. Boswell._ Sir, if I do not trouble you, will you explain to me
why Her Majesty should avoid Edinburgh at Christmas time?

_Dr. Johnson._ Why, sir, the very branches put up in honour of the
festive season would treat her with disrespect!

_Mr. Boswell._ Indeed, sir!

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, if Her Most Gracious Majesty visited Edinburgh at
Christmas time, would she not find _Holly-rood_?

_Mr. Boswell._ Another pun, sir!

âIt was another pun, sir!â cried the Doctor, very wrathfully, and I
said no more.

The next day we visited Stirling. We walked up to the Castle, and
admired the magnificent view we there obtained of the surrounding
country. We next examined the ramparts.

âThese old walls, sir,â said I, âmust weigh many thousand tons
avoirdupois.â

âSir,â replied the Doctor, âyou should have said pounds _Stirling_!â

âAnother pun, sir!â I exclaimed.

âIt was another pun, sir!â roared the Doctor, and I thought it best to
hold my peace.

[Illustration: DE MORTUIS

_Sympathetic Young Mother._ âI wunner ye could be sae cruel as to kill
that bonnie wee cauf!â

_Practical Butcher._ âWeel, ye see, yeâll no eat them leevinâ!â]

The next morning found us at Perth. Here we were received most
hospitably by the gentry and the people. In the company of our host (a
gentleman of the highest consideration in âThe Fair Cityâ), we ascended
Kinnoul Hill, and greatly admired the splendid scenery.

âA very lovely spot, sir,â I ventured to observe.

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, you are right. Sir, I have here found the people
so kind-hearted, the city so handsome, and the scenery so magnificent,
that I confess it would give me infinite satisfaction were I able to
call the town in which I was born the place (as the Highlanders have
it) of my _Perth_!

âA pun, sir!â exclaimed our excellent host, and I could not help
noticing that he seemed greatly surprised.

The Doctor made no reply, but I could see by the working of his
countenance that he was suffering pain.

We came to our journeyâs end at Wick.

âWhat do you think of this place, sir,â I asked.

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, I think that the title of âThe Modern Athensâ
should be conferred upon Wick rather than upon Edinburgh.

_Mr. Boswell._ Indeed, sir! May I ask why?

[Illustration: Q. E. D.

_Professor McPhairrson._ âNo, Mrs. Brown, itâs not that we Scots are
dull; but you English see a joke in _anything_! Why, the other day I
was in a room with four Englishmen, one of whom told a story, and,
would you believe it, I was the only man that didnât laugh!â]

_Dr. Johnson._ Why, sir? Sir, you must be very dull. I say, sir, that
Wick should be called âThe Modern Athens.â

_Mr. Boswell._ I confess, sir, that I am dull, and yet I cannot
perceive why Wick should be called âThe Modern Athensâ rather than
Edinburgh.

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, you indeed must be dull if you do not associate
Wick with the centre of _Greece_!

I was silent for a few minutes, and then I ventured to make a remark.

âSir,â said I, âyou once expressed a very strong opinion about
pun-makers. Sir, you asserted your belief that a man who would make a
pun would be capable of picking a pocket.â

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, I believe so still.

_Mr. Boswell._ And yet, sir, during the course of our tour, you have
made a large number of puns.

_Dr. Johnson._ Sir, you have good grounds for what you assert. I admit,
sir, with a feeling of sorrow, that I have made many puns during our
tour.

_Mr. Boswell._ Sir, may I venture to ask you why you have made so many
puns?

A SKETCH IN SCOTLAND

Since the immortal meeting of the Brick Lane Temperance Society, at
which the Messrs. Weller and the Reverend the Shepherd attended (after
refection elsewhere), and the latter, in response to the Chairmanâs fat
smile and invitation to address the meeting, declined, on the ground
that the meeting was drunk, we have seen nothing so good as this, which
we take from the _Dundee Courier_:--

 âOn Sunday last, the minister of a large congregation in Dundee was
 interrupted in the course of his forenoon sermon by the repeated
 coughing of his auditors. Pausing in the midst of his observations, he
 addressed his congregation to the following effect:--âYou go about the
 streets at the New Year time--you get drunk, and get cold, then you
 come here and cough, cough like a park of artillery. I think I must
 give you a vacation of six weeks, that you may have time to get sober,
 and to regain your health again.ââ

[Illustration: âMOST UNFORTUNATE!â

_Bailie McScrew (to Smith, on a short visit to the North)._ âAnâ what
are ye daenâ to-morrow nicht, Mester Smeth?â

_Smith._ âTo-morrow? Oh, nothing particular.â

_Bailie._ âAnâ the next nicht?â

_Smith._ âAh! on Friday Iâm to dine with the Browns----â

_Bailie._ âMan, thatâs a petty! Aw was gaun tâ ask ye to takâ yer
denner wiâ us oâ Friday!!â]

[Illustration: IN VINO MEMORIA

_Major Portsoken (a pretty constant guest)._ âI say, Buchanan, this

_Scots Butler._ âNa, thatâs aâ dune! There was thrutty dizzen; and

[Illustration: TITLES TO DISTINCTION

_Passenger (from the South, waking up)._ âPray, sir, what station is

_Native._ âThes es Paisley, sir!--Paisley! Celebrated toon,
sir!--Berrth-place oâ thâ poat Tannahul, sir! And--âhem?--ahâm a
Paisley man myselâ, sir! Ah was born iâ Paisley--ah was----â

  [_Luckily the train had now run into the station, and stopped._]

[Illustration: A PRACTICAL VIEW

_First Parishioner (to recently-appointed Minister)._ âVerra gled to
fall in wiâ ye, sir, anâ makâ yer acquaântance! I hinna been at the
kirk syne ye camâ, as I wis in Ross-shire.â

_Parson._ âWell, I am very pleased to meet you. You may have heard
whether my serm----â

_Parishioner._ âOh, aâ the fowk are greatly taken wiâ yer menners
anâ appearance, yer attention to the puir bodies oâ the parish, yer
visitinâ the sick, anâ----wha cares for preachinâ!â]

This lenitive application did good, for the congregation sat quiet,
and coughed no more than they would have dared to do had they been in
presence of the Queen, or any other great person, instead of being in
a mere church. But one seat-holder, though he held his seat, could
not hold his tongue, and declared that the congregation was insulted.
We suspect that the minister knew best. In fact, had the incident
occurred anywhere but in Scotland, where every man is proverbially
sober, we should have been sure that the minister knew best. Hurrah,
for the toddy of Bonnie Dundee!

SPORTIVE SONGS

(_An enamoured Southron endeavours to address a Highland Damsel in her
own tongue_)

  Yon sky is bonny blue, fair lass,
    But you boast bluer een;
  Yon sun is bricht the noo, fair lass,
    Your locks hae brichter sheen;
  The fowl ahint the windy scaur
    Flees to its hame awaâ,
  But, oh! my heart is fleeter far
    Wheneâer I hear you caâ.

  The cushat seeks the hazel broch
    Therein his mate to woo,
  But I hie to the mountain loch
    To lilt my lays oâ loâe.
  For here it was I speered you first
    In aâ your pride oâ race,
  You set my ardent soul athirst
    When I gazed on your face!

  I sat me down beside that cairn,
    And looked, a feckless loon,
  On you, the great MacMuckleâs bairn,
    Wiâ neâer a pair oâ shoon!
  Wiâ winsome feet sae white as milk
    You paddlit iâ the faem,
  Your snoodless locks, sae soft as silk,
    Whished rounâ your gouden kaem!

 I looked and looked, and marvelled sair
    If human you might be;
  You laughed to see the wonder-stare
    That came frae oot my ee.
  And then you broke the eerie spell,
    And oh! your voice was douce!
  Like water trickling frae a shell,
    What time the ebb runs loose!

  Anâ noo I maun my heart declare!
    (Would you could hear its beat.)
  Iâve lands, and siller, too, to spare,
    Anâ sic a hamestead sweet!
  I ken you are MacMuckleâs chiel,
    His only dearest ane,
  But tell him that I loâe you weel,
    And canna bide alane!

A NEW âADDRESS TO THE DEILâ

(_A long way after Robbie Burns_)

  Oh, thou! whatever name, great Sir,
  Prince Lucio, or plain Lucifer,
  As up-to-date, thou mayâst prefer,--
              Theyâre nane great catches,
  Whether derived frae classic or
              Frae brimstone matches!--

  Hear me, great Alias, for a wee!
  The leddies winna let thee be.
  Yeâd think smaâ pleasure it could gie,
              Eâen to she-novelist,
  To drag thee frae the obscuritee
              Wherein thou grovellest.

  But leddies wiâ an eye to fame,
  Take leeberties wiâ thy dread name,
  Thy wanderings frae thy woefuâ hame,
              Lang fixed afar;
  Painting thee neither black, nor lame,
              As auld fients are.

  True, Wullie Shakspeare ance did say
  Thou wert âa gentleman.â But to-day
  The leddies limn thee masher gay,
              Modish and maudlinâ,
  Weel-groomed, about the public way
              Daundering and dawdlinâ.

  The Prince of Darkness as a dude,
  Callow and cantinâ, crass and crude,
  Compound of prater, prig, male-prude,
            And minor poet,
  Is--weel, I wadnaâ here intrude
            _The_ word--ye know it!

  Milton and Goethe whyles might summon
  Thine image forth, a graund, grim, glum âun;
  But âtis beyond the scribblinâ woman
            Wiâ truth to paint ye.
  Sheâll makâ ye a reedeeculous rum âun,
            Unsex, half saint ye!

  Thrasonic Bobadil the bard,
  Wha deems Parnassus his backyard,
  Tried to invoke thy presence--hard;
            As did great âFestus.â
  But somehow their attempts, ill-starred,
            Scarce eenterest us.

  They havenaâ the true grit and grup
  In mighty shape to raise _ye_ up.
  They whaâd on _genuine_ horrors sup,
            And scare a body,
  Are not inspired by raw pork-chop,
            Anâ whusky-toddy.

  But oh! a leddy-novelistâs Deil
  Wad scarcely gar a bairnie squeel!
  Like Hotspurâs âsarcenet oath,â we feel
            It hath nae terror.
  Is lathen dagger taâen for steel
            A greater error?

  Sorrows oâ Satan! Aye, good lack!
  âTis bad to paint ye owre black;
  But thus whitewash ye! Oh! quack! quack!
              His truest âsorrowâ
  Satan from the she-scribblerâs knack
              Must surely borrow.

  Yeâve borne some wrangs at hands oâ men,
  But frae the writing-womanâs pen,

THE DECAY OF THE KILT

  _Mr. Briggs loquitur_:

  I am going down to Scotland, to the country of the kilt,
  For a little salmon-stalking in a place they call Glen Tilt;
  And as I always like to be a Roman when at Rome,
  Iâve purchased the correct costume and it has just come home.

  For aâ the year I hevna seen a single kilt but ane--
  A wee bit white-legged Coackney whaâ was trudginâ through the rain;
  The water it was pourinâ owre his knees intil his shoes,
  Anâ eh! but he was wishinâ for a pair oâ honest trews.

A SCOTS BALL-ROOM BALLAD

(_By The MacPry_)

  Why sit ye on the stair, ladie,
    Why sit ye on the stair?
  Itâs merry dancing in the hall,
    And partners still are there.

  Ye arena in a cosy neuk,
    But in the lampâs full glare;
  No gentle whisperinâ words are spoke--
    Why sit ye on the stair?

  The runkled carle thatâs by your side
    No tale of luve can tell;
  He fain wad win ye for his bride
    By talkinâ oâ himselâ.

  Your voice is clear, your laugh is cheer,
    But oh, your eyes are sad;
  You answer what the gaffer says,
    Youâre lookinâ for the lad.

  (They winna stint their prattlinâ talk--
    Oh, but her eyes are sad!--
  Tis vain to cherche the fammy here,
    Iâll gang and speer the lad.)

  Why prop ye up the waâ, laddie,
    Why prop ye up the waâ?
  Your lissom shoes are stickit oot,
    Yeâll gar the dancers faâ.

  Or feckless couples tearinâ past,
    Wiâ elbows at an angle,
  Will pin ye to the wainscoat fast
    As wild boar in a jungle.

  The floorâs as smooth as summer grass
    Smaâ feet, like crickets, caper,
  And whirlinâ kirtles, as they pass,
    Sair waste the swealing taper.

  The lassiesâ gowns are creased and rent;
    The lads are oot oâ knowledge;
  They are as hot wiâ twirlinâ roon
    As blacksmith frae the village.

  The fiddles pour their love-sick prayârs
    The flutie-man is whisâlinâ,
  Just like when ancient madam scares
    A thrummock-touzle hisslinâ.

  Thereâs young folks movinâ like a fair,
    Thereâs auld folks quaffinâ sherry.
  Anâ you sae weary, fuâ oâ care,
    When all the world is merry?

  Gin ye maun feed your dowie grudge,
    At least fill up your programme,
  And come victorious from the crush
    Like Bonaparte from Wagram.

  Nay, dinna off the lassie score;
    Her heart sings, âWaly, waly!â
  Sheâs talkinâ with that awfuâ bore,
    The Laird oâ Lanthorn Jawley.

  Quit, quit, for shame! This winna do.
    Rouse up and play the man, sir!
  For they should dance who have the chance,
    And they should sup who can, sir.

  Ah, see, she smiles! Could any word
    More eloquently call ye?
  Now go and soothe your bonnie burd,
    And banish Lanthorn Jawley.

  So prop nae mair the waâ, laddie,
    So prop nae mair the waâ----â
  (Ye dinna ken that on your coat
    Yon candle-droppinâs faâ?)

DEAR MAISTER PUNCH,--Iâve heerd often enough aboot ye as a kind sort oâ
buddy, whae putts the warld richt, _when it has gaun wrang_, and Iâm
thinking to write tae ye, a screed about thae feckless critters, the
Southâren tourists whae owerrun Auld Scotland at this time oâ the year
with their _coo-ponds_ and their _excursion tuckets_, thinking to tak
their pleesures on the cheap. Noo, the hotels in this country are famed
for their vera moderate charges. I mysel have had a real good breakfast
(they caâ it _dijohnny_ now) for no more than _five shullings_--thatâs
cheap enough. And as for a bed! weel, no one can find faut with half
of a sovereign? And yet thae tourists are aye complaininâ. Hotel
folk in Scotland should have fixed charges throughout. I, _for yin_,
will make free to say that I will cheerfully pay them, _when I find it
necessary_, one pound ten shullinâs for bed and breakfast and maybe
half-a-croon for a good glass of the cratur, as a settler afterwards.
If the hotel folk would all agree to some moderate charge like that,
they could think aboot Culloden with eequanimity!

  Yours most friend-like,
  ALEXANDER MACWHUSTLE.

A BALLAD OF EDINBOROâ TOON

  The lusty sun did glower aboon,
    Wiâ welcome in his cheerfuâ rays;
  I walked in Edinboroâ toon,
        Aâ in ma caller claes.

  For I had donned ma coat oâ cheiks
    That cost me guineas twa anâ three.
  But and ma pair oâ ditto breeks
        That luiked sae pleasantlie.

  On ilka breek were creasies twa;
    And they did hang sae fine, sae fine,
  Frae John oâ Groats to Gallowaâ
        Were nane sae fair as mine.

  Anâ first I honoured Geordie Street,
    Anâ syne I walked the Princes ane,
  To gie to ilka lass a treat
        Anâ aâ the laddies pain.

  Anâ mony a laddieâs hert was sair;
    Anâ mony a lassieâs een, ay, mony,
  Uplicht wiâ joy to see a pair
        Sae canny anâ sae bonny.

  I hadna walked an hour at maist,
    I hadna honoured half the toon,
  The air grew drumlie likâ a ghaist,
        Anâ syne the rain camâ doon.

  Anâ first the dust it gently laid,
    Anâ syne it camâ in cats anâ doggies,
  That loosed the cobble-stanes and played
        Auld Hornie wiâ ma toggies.

  O waly for ma coat oâ cheicks
    That cost me guineas twa and three!
  Anâ waly for ma ditto breeks
        Sae bagsome at the knee!

  The creasies twa are past recaâ
    That gard them hang sae fine, sae fine,
  Frae John oâ Groats to Gallowaâ
        Are nane sae puir as mine!

  O fause, inhospitable toon,
    I rede thee, gin I come again,

  Thou dear and gracious town, where I

  The hour has come that bids me fly;

  Right heavy am I that we must part,
    For lo, I know not where or when
  Iâve met so--down, poor fluttering heart!--
    And more agreeable men.

  Forgive me that I spake in haste
    Winged words that I would fain forget;
  Thy welcome seemed in doubtful taste,
    And I was very wet!

  But rather hold his memory dear,
    Whose sunny presence brought thee forth
  The finest weather of the year,
    And warmed the watery North.

  Now onward speeds the busy train,
    O hospitable town and kind,
  Farewell! Until I come again,
    I leave my heart behind.

CHAPTER I.

We were all sitting on the pig-sty at Tânowheadâs Farm. A pig-sty is
not, perhaps, a strictly eligible seat, but there were special reasons,
of which you shall hear something later, for sitting on this particular
pig-sty.

The old sow was within, extended at full length. Occasionally she
grunted approval of what was said, but, beyond that, she seemed to show
but a faint interest in the proceedings. She had been a witness of
similar gatherings for some years, and, to tell the truth, they had
begun to bore her, but, on the whole, I am not prepared to deny that
her appreciation was an intelligent one. Behind us was the brae. Ah,
that brae! Do you remember how the child you once were sat in the brae,
spinning the peerie, and hunkering at I-dree I-dree I droppit-it? Do
you remember that? Do you even know what I mean? Life is like that.
When we are children the bread is thick, and the butter is thin; as
we grow to be lads and lassies, the bread dwindles, and the butter
increases; but the old men and women who totter about the commonty, how
shall they munch when their teeth are gone? Thatâs the question. Iâm a
Dominie. What!--no answer? Go to the bottom of the class, all of you.

Chapter II.

As I said, we were all on the pig-sty. Of the _habituÃ©s_ I scarcely
need to speak to you, since you must know their names, even if you fail
to pronounce them. But there was a stranger amongst us, a stranger
who, it was said, had come from London. Yesterday when I went ben the
house I found him sitting with Jess; to-day, he, too, was sitting with
us on the pig-sty. There were tales told about him, that he wrote for
papers in London, and stuffed his vases and his pillows with money, but
Tammas Haggart only shook his head at what he called âsuch auld fowksâ
yeppins,â and evidently didnât believe a single word. Now Tammas,
you must know, was our humorist. It was not without difficulty that
Tammas had attained to this position, and he was resolved to keep
it. Possibly he scented in the stranger a rival humorist whom he would

genial cordiality characteristic of Scots weavers, and many were the
anxious looks exchanged amongst us, as we watched the preparations
for the impending conflict.

Chapter III.

After Tammas had finished boring half-a-dozen holes in the old sow with
his sarcastic eye, he looked up, and addressed Hendry McQumpha.

âHendry,â he said, âye ken Iâm a humorist, div ye no?â

Hendry scratched the old sow meditatively, before he answered.

âOu ay,â he said, at length. âIâm no saying âat yeâre no a humorist.
I ken fine yeâre a sarcesticist, but thereâs other humorists in the
world, am thinkinâ.â

This was scarcely what Tammas had expected. Hendry was usually one of
his most devoted admirers. There was an awkward silence, which made me
feel uncomfortable. I am only a poor Dominie, but some of my happiest
hours had been passed on the pig-sty. Were these merry meetings to come
to an end? Pete took up the talking.

âHendry, my man,â he observed, as he helped himself out of Tammasâs
snuff-mull, âyeâre ower kyow-owy. Ye ken humourâs a thing âat spouts
out oâ its ain accord, anâ thereâs no nae spouter in Thrums âat can
match wiâ Tammas.â

[Illustration: A VESTED INTEREST

_Bystander (to excited Scot, whose friend had been run over)._ âNot a
near relative, I hope, sir.â

_Scot._ âNa--but--he has on a pair of ma breeks!â]

He looked defiantly at Hendry, who was engaged in searching for coppers
in his north-east-by-east-trouser pocket. Tânowhead said nothing, and
Hookey was similarly occupied. At last, the stranger spoke.

âGentlemen,â he began, âmay I say a word? I may lay claim to some
experience in the matter. I travel in humour, and generally manage to
do a large business.â

He looked round interrogatively. Tammas eyed him with one of his keen
glances. Then he worked his mouth round and round to clear the course
for a sarcasm.

âSo youâre the puir crittur,â said the stone-breaker, ââatâs meaninâ to
be a humorist.â

This was the challenge. We all knew what it meant, and fixed our eyes
on the stranger.

[Illustration: A TARTAR

Dr. MâCurrie (a chilly old soul), having ascertained from his landlady
that coals are sixpence a scuttle, politely insists on providing
a scuttle of his own, and begs to return, with many thanks, the
charmingly tasteful article she had intended for his use.]

[Illustration: SOLILOQUY

âIf I hold on, Iâll lose my train; if I let go, Iâll faâ! Did ever
onybody hear tell oâ sic a predicament?â]

[Illustration: âTHE GARB OF OLD GAULâ

_Native (to visitor from the South)._ âAh, youâve donned the kilt!
Quite killing, I declare! But why do you wear the Macdonald tartan when
your name is Thompson?â

_Little T. (who has been getting a good deal of chaff)._ âFâr a very
good reason--âcause Iâve paid for it!â

  [_Retires in a huff._]

âCertainly,â was his answer; âthat is exactly my meaning. I trust I
make myself plain. Iâm willing to meet any man at catch-weights. Now
here,â he continued, âare some of my samples. This story about a
house-boat, for instance, has been much appreciated. Itâs almost in the
style of Mr. Jeromeâs masterpiece; or this screamer about my wifeâs
tobacco-pipe and the smoking mixture. Observe,â he went on, holding
the sample near to his mouth, âI can expand it to any extent. Puff,
puff! Ah! it has burst. No matter, these accidents sometimes happen to
the best regulated humorists. Now, just look at these,â he produced
half-a-dozen packets rapidly from his bundle. âHere we have a packet
of sarcasm--equal to dynamite. I left it on the steps of the Savile
Club, but it missed fire somehow. Then here are some particularly neat
things in cheques. I use them myself to paper my bedroom. Itâs simpler
and easier than cashing them, and besides,â adjusting his mouth to his
sleeve, and laughing, âitâs quite killing when you come to think of it
in that way. Lastly, thereâs this banking-account sample, thoroughly
suitable for journalists and children. You see how itâs done. I open
it, you draw on it. Oh, you donât want a drawing-master, any fellow
can do it, and the point is it never varies. Now,â he concluded,
aggressively, âwhat have you got to set against that, my friend?â

[Illustration: _Sandy McPherson, in a moment of abstraction, put
half-a-crown in the collection plate last Sunday in mistake for a
penny, and has since expended a deal of thought as to the best way of
making up for it._ âNoo I might stay awaâ frae the kirk till the sum
was made up; but on the ither hanâ I wad be payinâ pew rent aâ the time
anâ gettinâ nae guid oâ ât. Losh! but Iâm thinkinâ this is what the
meenister caâs a âreleegious defficulty!ââ]

We all looked at Tammas. Hendry kicked the pail towards him, and he
put his foot on it. Thus we knew that Hendry had returned to his
ancient allegiance, and that the stranger would be crushed. Then Tammas
began----

âMan, man, thereâs no nae doubt âat ye lauch at havers, anâ thereâs
mony âat lauchs at your clipper-clapper, but theyâre no Thrums fowk,
and they cannaâ lauch richt. But we maun juist settle this matter. When
weâre taâen up wiâ the makkinâ oâ humour, weâre aâ dependent on other
fowk to takâ note oâ the humour. Thereâs no nane oâ us âatâs lauched at
anything youâve telt us. But theyâll lauch at me. Noo then,â he roared
out, ââA pie sat on a pear-tree.ââ

We all knew this song of Tammasâs. A shout of laughter went up from the
whole gathering. The stranger fell backwards into the sty a senseless
mass.

âMan, man,â said Hookey to Tammas, as we walked home; âwhat a crittur
ye are! What pit that in your heed?â

[Illustration: âTHE QUEENâS ENGLISHâ (OR SCOTCH)

_Minister._ âWeel, John, an hoo did ye like ma sonâs discoorse?â

_John._ âWeel, meenister, ah maun admeet heâs vera soond, but, oh man!
heâs no deep! His pronoonciationâs no vera gweed; but ahâve nae doobt
heâll impruvâ!â]

âIt juist took a grip oâ me,â replied Tammas, without moving a muscle;
âit flashed upon me âat heâd no stand that auld song. Thatâs where the
humour oâ it comes in.â

âOu, ay,â added Hendry, âThrums is the place for rale humour.â On the
whole, I agree with him.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
