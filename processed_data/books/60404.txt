                              DEDICATED TO
                      THE BOYS IN KHAKI AND BLUE.


    Dear boys,

    I am dedicating my first little book to you because you have
    written and told me so often from the North Sea, from âSomewhere
    in France,â from Africa, and Mesopotamia that my queer sketches
    have brightened for you some dull or gloomy hours. Bless you!
    for if that is true, why then I feel that even your frivolous
    Eve has done her âbitâ in this terrible heartrending struggle.
    And you will understand, dear boys, that I haveânotwithstanding
    Aunt Matildaâs and Uncle Fredâs disapprovalâkept gay and
    frivolous to please _you_, and not because I didnât understand
    and appreciate what you were doing for me, and other little
    Eves, and above all for our dear old country, which you have
    saved. Bless you all again and again. That all you wish may come
    to you as freely and as welcome as your generous appreciation
    has come to me is the constant wish ofâ

                       Your loving little friend,

                                                                EVE.

    P.S.âTou-Tou sends a fond lick.

                                PREFACE.


                            By Richard King.

It is not often that an artist evolves a new typeâmore especially a new
comic type. But this is the proud achievement of the artist whose work
adorns this little book. âEveâ has now become a clearly recognised
figure of modern life, as clearly recognised as are the figures of
George Belcher, Dana Gibson, and Bateman, and that very small band of
clever artists who have characteristics peculiar to themselves.

Few artists, however, have more quickly sprung into world-wide
popularity than âEve.â How great this popularity is may be judged by the
numerous imitators which, while they copy many of Eveâs mannerisms, lose
all that humour and spirit which make of Eveâs art such a fascinating
and irresistible thing. For Eve possesses a gift which cannot be
imitated, no matter how clever the artist who imitates her may be. Each
personâs sense of humourâor lack of itâbelongs to them alone. And it is
Eveâs humour which make her delightful drawings so appealing. She has
that sense of the âabsurdâ which is one of the rarest senses in all
black-and-white art. And yet, while her irresistible humour makes one
laugh, while her drawings fascinate us by their quaintness, she is never
so far removed from reality as to be merely a painter of the human
grotesque. Therein lies so much of her genius. She paints humanity with
the eye of one who can see the comic in everyday people and things, and
yet she never lets her feeling for the ridiculous obliterate her feeling
for Truth. It is to be regretted that the clever letters which these
drawings originally illustrated in âThe Tatlerâ cannot be reproduced on
account of their topicality.

But in judging these fascinating drawings merely from the point of view
of their humour and charm, one is apt to overlook the fact that
Eveâwhile possessing a style which is uniqueâis also, and at the same
time, a designer of remarkable gifts. It is, perhaps, as a designer that
she will appeal most greatly to an artist. Each of her drawings is an
exquisite example of this gift for design. Their line, their
âproportion,â as it were, and the clever use she makes of blackâbig
splashes of blackâall help to make her drawings exquisite little
picturesââpicturesâ in the popular senseâas well as wonderful examples
of technique and imagination. Another thing about all her drawings is
their feminine daintiness. Each design is as dainty as the heroine who
appears in nearly all of them. With a few strokes, a dot here and there,
a line, she can suddenly bring before our eyes a perfectly-recognisable
type. In this way her gifts are superior even to Phil May, who surely,
more than many artists, obtained his effects with the least number of
unessentials.

Moreover, Eve never draws what I must call a âdeadâ figure.
Everyoneâeverything, almostâis alive. Her animalsâburlesques of animals
though they beâare full of character and fun. Even such things as
motor-cars, ships, and carriagesâwhich, from the point of view of an
artist painting nothing but the truth, are out of all proportionâpossess
a quaintness which somehow accords better with the picture than if they
were perfect models of technical knowledge and drawing.

Eve gives a comic twist to men and women of this world, but in that
comic âtwistâ we seem to see and know them better, and to know them
better is to love them more. That is one of the reasons, perhaps, why
these fascinating drawings are so popular and so adored.

âThe Adventures of Eve


[Illustration:

  _Being an irresponsible record of some incidents in the career of a
    frivolous little ladyâto say nothing of Adam, Aunt Matilda, Uncle
    Fred, and Tou-Tou._
]

[Illustration:

  _The successful invasion of the London stage by American artistes
    induces Eve to abandon her habitual reserve and appear (for charity)
    in a revue especially written for her by Sir Peter Pan. In order to
    avoid shocking the susceptibilities of the âpast smart set,â who are
    these war times very early-Victorian, she has depicted herself at
    the moment when her scarcity of costume was obliterated by the mass
    of floral tributes hurled by an enraptured audience_

Eve as a Policeman
and
Some War-time Cooks.


[Illustration:

  _Eve, Evelyn, and Evelinda rising to the occasion by forming a posse
    of police. With the aid of Uncle Fred they practise the necessary
    gymnastics to fit them for the force with such success thatâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âthey are able to astonish and convince a real copper as to their
    suitability for action_
]

[Illustration:

  _Servant Susieâs making shells for soldiers, so a splendid example is
    set to the ordinary citizeness by the titled rich, who are busy
    taking cookery lessons. It is, indeed, right that we stay-at-home
    men should in our trenchers share the dangers of our active brothers
    in their trenches_
]




The Dramatic
Story of Eveâs
Career as a
Hospital Nurse.


[Illustration:

  _A daily paper says, âYou can always tell when a girl has a young man
    at the front by the regimental badge she wears.â Eve likes the idea,
    and being at the moment enraptured with a Highland laddie determines
    that the world shall know it_
]

[Illustration:

  _Those people who were wont to think the tight skirt unwomanly are
    hoping that the full skirt will bring back the modesty of the
    Victorian era. Eve hopes so, too; here she is in the new spotted
    veil cultivating a demure expression_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve and her sisters, Evelyn and Evelinda, tired of enforced
    inactivity, decide to do their bit at the frontâor near it, and are
    here seen making their preparations for departure_
]

[Illustration:

  _Here we have the wet and warm farewells on the parental doorstep. We
    have sternly pointed out to Eve that her costume is not the
    regulation one for the nursing sisterhood; but, as Eve says, all
    that matters is to look nice and be nice_
]

[Illustration:

  _When Eve, Evelyn, and Evelinda arrived at their destination they were
    promptly set to work scrubbing the floors and washing the dishes,
    while less ornamental but considerably more useful workers attended
    to the dear soldiers. Eve, Evelyn, and Evelinda, if disappointed,
    were full of patriotism, so they workedâand worked_â
]

[Illustration:

  _Till the authorities, in pure compassion, assisted our tired little
    friends back home_â
]

[Illustration:

  _Where, with the blissful consciousness of duty done, may still be
    found wrapped in dreamless slumber Eve, Evelyn, and Evelinda_
]




Eve Stays on the
East Coast with
Uncle Fredâ


[Illustration:

  _Eve goes down to the east coast for a rest cure. The first night she
    heard a bang and woke with a start and a cry of âOh, dear! Oh,
    dear!â_
]

[Illustration:

  _Uncle Fred, her kind and genial host, also awoke with a start and a
    cry of âââ âââ (censored). âItâs those ââ Zeppelins,â he said_
]

[Illustration:

  _It was Zeppelins, and Eve and uncle came down three flights of stairs
    like shells from a gun, while, as for poisonous gasâwell, you should
    have heard Uncle Fred!_
]

[Illustration:

  â_I repeat, you should have heard Uncle Fred when he landed with Eve
    on the top of him. It was the finest hymn of hate ever heard on the
    east coast_
]




âAnd Enjoys her First
Experience of the Zeps.


[Illustration:

  _Anyway, here are Eve and uncle entrenched under the dining-room
    table. Eve is saying, âAre your teeth chattering, dear?â which is
    annoying uncle, for, as Eve well knows, they are up in the glass on
    his dressing-table_
]

[Illustration:

  _Soon the Zeppelins passed away, and uncle, who had suffered severely
    down the stairs, made a slow but comfortable recovery_
]

[Illustration:

  â_And is now having the time of his life in London, where admiring
    crowds of both sexes take him for a wounded hero straight from the
    front. Uncle Fred is himself beginning to believe he has been there_
]




Eve Buys
a Motor
Car.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


[Illustration:

  _Eve, deciding that pedestrianism in these days of lady-driven cars is
    too dangerous and exciting a pursuit, determines to get a runabout
    of her own. Regard her then endeavouring to fascinate one of the
    typical little nuts which in those days adorned a fashionable
    garage_
]

[Illustration:

  _The car being chosen and the preliminary instructions having been
    obtained, Eve, full of pride and rapture, bids farewell to her
    little friend and sets forth to astound and arouse the envy of her
    dearest friends in the park_
]

[Illustration:

  _Astound them she certainly didânot the less because of the regularity
    with which she mistakenly pressed down the accelerator instead of
    the brake. Here we see her during one of the forward leaps
    consequent on the error_
]

[Illustration:

  _No mechanism, any more than any man, was ever built to resist Eveâs
    unexpected little ways, with the result that she, although assured
    as to the astonishment of her friends, is less certain as to the
    envy she aroused. (In case of any misunderstanding, we may add that
    the picture is supposed to represent Eve trying to repair her car in
    the most crowded and fashionable spot in the park)_
]

[Illustration:

  _However, all troubles come eventually to an end, and Adam, poor dear,
    just back from the trenches, learns at last what real fear means.
    The fat rolling lines at the bottom of the picture are supposed to
    represent the dust which kindly Nature raised to hide the casualties
    in Eveâs wake, but in reality they were put in to hide Eveâs
    weakness in drawing car wheels_
]

[Illustration:

  _The shortage in postmen grows apace. Eve, as ever, steps into the
    breach, and you can imagine the unadulterated joy of one of her
    admirers who, unshorn and untidy, opens the door of his flat to
    receive from her a pink and scented missive_
]

[Illustration:

  _She signalises Italyâs splendid entry into the field of hostilities
    on the side of the Allies by adopting the famous Bersaglieri
    headgear_
]

[Illustration:

  _War economy proceeds apace, and Eve shows us that since brandy balls
    and âsich likeâ have taken the place of the tiny liqueur, society,
    straining after simplicity and innocence, has adopted a popular game
    reminiscent of our childhood. Adam, lucky man, drops the sweet,
    which the expectant fair catch in their tiny mouths_
]




Just a Few Odds and Ends.

[Illustration:

  _Study of Eve pondering deeply as to how she can help, these critical
    times. (We donât wear sleeves on our nighties nowadaysâfor economyâs
    sake)_
]

[Illustration:

  _The merit of the poor âspecialâ who guards gasworks and bridges is,
    in Eveâs opinion, sadly overlooked. A few little charming al fresco
    suppers to a few special âspecialsâ is a duty she delights in_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eves are not only driving âbuses, but also conducting them these war
    times. Our picture represents the old brigade of âbus riders
    helplessly imploring our heroine to stop and pick them up. Eve,
    however, having landed a few khaki heroes, is forsaking the regular
    route to take them for a little joy-ride to Richmond Park_

The Zeps
Threaten
Again.


[Illustration:

  _Alas! the Coaching Clubsâ fascinating meets are a thing of the past_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve draws up a list of things to do if the Zeps do come. She is seen
    reading it to Tou-Tou, who is visibly impressed_
]

[Illustration:

  _She carefully packs her hamper every night in case she may have to
    pic-nic out among the dÃ©bris of her home the next day. Tou-Tou, as
    you see, is wearing his respirator_
]

[Illustration:

  _Here we have a vivid picture of Eve, hamper packed and ready (Tou-Tou
    on guard), keeping one eye open for the alarm. A considerable
    clamour awakens her, so_â
]

[Illustration:

  â_she arises fixes her respirator, and prepares to descend to the
    darkness of the cellars_â
]

[Illustration:

  â_only to find the disturbance was caused by a cordon of those gallant
    fellows, the âExtry-Spechuls,â who are visibly determined to guard
    her from all possible calamity_

Eve Mobilises
her Sisters.


[Illustration:

  _Patriotic women are energetically undertaking the work of Adams
    engaged in military duties. Eve desires to form a corps to
    supplement âthe Methusiliersâ or âthe Last Gaspersâ in case of
    invasion. Here is Eve being sworn inâa new experience, though,
    thanks to Uncle Fred, she is used to being sworn at_
]

[Illustration:

  _This is not the frivolous picture it appears, but represents little
    Eves in training for E.C.D.C. (Eveâs Coastal Defence Corps). Of
    course, the first thing to do is to learn to swim. Eve cannot tell
    us where this is taking place, as it would give away the (amatory)
    disposition of the Grand Fleet, which anchored dangerously close in
    soon after operations commenced_
]

[Illustration:

  _They found firing practice a little trying and dangerous, although
    the method of holding the rifle as demonstrated by our artist
    certainly mitigates the unpleasantness of the kick back_
]

[Illustration:

  _The cavalry section also had their difficulties_
]

[Illustration:

  _But the grand finale of the procession of the various units of the
    corps through London was an immediate success. The immense concourse
    of young men which followed in its wake were all inveigled into the
    recruiting office, a result which of course justified to the full
    the existence of the corps_

Eveâs Adventure
with the Gallant
Submarine.


[Illustration:

  _Eve, overcome by her war energies in London, returns to the east
    coast, where we find her enjoying a peaceful dip far, as one would
    think, from warâs alarms. But_â
]

[Illustration:

  â_suddenly she sees one of Englandâs gallant submarines appearing to
    investigate her presence. Her intense interest in its approach
    blinds her to the fact of an inimical gas-bag approaching with the
    evident intention of making the important capture of our little
    friend with the grappling iron_
]

[Illustration:

  _This is just Tou-Tou in Imperial mood_ (_it has nothing to do with
    the submarine story, but fills an awkward blank_.âEVE)

[Illustration:

  _The bold and wicked air-pirates grappled Eve as planned, but (hooray
    for the Navy!) the gallant officer on the conning tower was able to
    seize her shapely limbs as she drifted over him, and, with the help
    of his equally gallant crew, effected a rescue at the expense of
    Eveâs already diminutive bathing creation_â

    service, applies for and obtains a situation as clerk in the office
    of a susceptible merchant_â

    to her progress, causes the first rift in the lute between her

[Illustration:

  _Finally, every clerk being prostrate with heart weakness, and the
    clerical work in the office at a standstill, Eveâs business career

Triumphs.


[Illustration:

  _Eve has spent many sleepless nights brooding over her accumulated

    developedâwith ease and rapidityâan activity of shopping under the
    discredited banner of âBusiness as Usualâ_

[Illustration:

  _The chill ferocity with which Adam received her âlittleâ accounts has

  _The young man who has Cook-toured the Dardanelles in the past, and
    who on the strength of it insists on explaining at great length the
    operations there, is sentenced to be sent back at once, to be used
    as a sand bag or a buzzer_
]

[Illustration:

  _And last but not least, the gentlemen who invented the wide skirt are
    sentenced to be smothered in their own creations. We regret that
    Eveâs feelings should, after administering justice, have induced her
    to administer a most unjudicial poke with her parasol in the rear
    flank of the destroyer of her peace. Tou-Tou is also seen advancing
    to the attack_

And Now
a Little
Racing.


[Illustration:

  _Eve, momentarily weary of well-doing, goes for a holiday and a dayâs
    racing_
]

[Illustration:

  _On every hand, with that air of mystery so necessary to all real
    racing âheads,â her admirers urge her to back Mr. Jolly Soelâs
    horse, which she is proceeding to do. Whenâ_
]

[Illustration:

  â_she catches sight of a jockey whose looks attract her, and whose
    colours satisfy her artistic sense. Naturally she puts âher shirtâ
    (as Adam so vulgarly expressed it) on his mount_
]

[Illustration:

  _Her attendant Adams scoff at her foolishness, and Eve has many
    anxious moments as the race proceeds_â
]

[Illustration:

  â_but, of course, Eveâs charger rolls home first, and her feelings
    overcome her to such an extent that she embraces the attractive
    jockey in the open. (We regret that the horse, which is on the left
    of the picture, has only two legs. Eve refuses to draw any more for
    the money)_

Eve Becomes
a Policewoman.


[Illustration:

  _With the idea of releasing an able-bodied âbobbyâ for action, Eve
    determines to join the womenâs police, and is seen preparing herself
    for her dayâs beautyâor rather duty_
]

[Illustration:

  _She found there was no difficulty in stopping the male traffic,
    although jealous and inefficient females evinced a desire to âpass
    alongââwith their snub-noses in the air. Everything was going
    beautifully until_â
]

[Illustration:

  â_a gust of wind seriously disturbed the equanimity of our little
    policewoman in the manner above pictorially described. It ended in
    stopping the traffic for miles round_â

[Illustration:

  â_as, of course, her damaged coiffure had to be rearranged, amid
    sarcastic comments from the females âafore mentionedâ_â

  â_which for once thoroughly upset our tired little heroine, who was
    herself âtaken upâ dead beat and conveyed home by gallant members of
    the sister services_

Uncle Fred
is Again
Victimised.


[Illustration:

  _Eve has a magnificent idea for helping on the war. Meeting Uncle Fred
    in the park, she wheedles him into escorting her into the Saveloy
    Hotelâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âwhere she is overcome with a sudden faintness, which disappears as
    soon as the perturbed uncle has given her a liqueur brandy. With
    commendable patriotism she has him arrested on the spot for
    treating, and_
]

[Illustration:

  _âthe result is a considerable contribution to the funds available for
    the prosecution of the war_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve would very much like to know why one meets such numbers of young
    soldiers in the âfrilliesâ department at the various stores. To meet
    oneâs fiancÃ© in the midst of trousseau preparations is, to say the
    least of it, awkward_
]

[Illustration:

  _The fact that the air raid on London, if coming, cannot be much
    longer postponed, combined with the warm and darkening summer
    evenings, has rendered the game of Zep-watching more popular than
    ever. Many gallant soldiers are daily âbombedâ into matrimony in
    consequence_

[Illustration:

  _This is a battle picture, and shows a massed attack by Eves and
    attendant Tou-Tous on Mr. Justice âBlank,â who dared to criticise

Eve Works
and Plays.


[Illustration:

  _Reminiscences of gay, glad years that are past flicker through Eveâs
    frivolous mind. She remembers the picturesqueness which ever graced
    the appearance of Eve, Evelyn, and Evelindaâ_

  _âcontrasted with the stern utility of the costumes she now wears.
    However, as Eve says, contrast is the salt of life andâ_

Eve and
her Lonely
Soldier.


[Illustration:

  _Eveâin her lonelinessâhas adopted a lonely soldier, and writes
    faithfully to him every evening_
]

[Illustration:

  _Wishing to make life pleasanter for him she orders for him many
    articles of male attire and other comforting trifles_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve, finding that the testing of cigars for the lonely one is a
    somewhat unpleasant business, causes a certain amount of friction
    with Adam by sending him the ones she knows that Adam keeps for
    himself and his particular friends_
]

[Illustration:

  _When the lonely soldier comes home Eve goes forth to meet him in her
    very best with his photograph dangling gracefully round her neck for
    identification purposes_
]

[Illustration:

  _At the station (it is a station) Eve meets her lonely friend, but
    finds to her astonishment, when she warmly greets him, he does not
    return it with any enthusiasm. Turning round she sees to her
    horrorânot unmixed with fearâthat his wife, whom she hadnât heard
    anything about, has also arrived on the scene_

Eve
Goes
into the
Beauty
Business.


[Illustration:

  _Eve, Evelyn, and Evelinda find they simply must do something to pay
    for the rise in hats consequent on these horrid war taxesâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âso, with a view to keeping some of the new officers up to old form,
    they start a beauty barberâs shop for the blue and khakiâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âwhich is an immense success from the day of opening. Isnât Adam on
    the right getting a dinky frothing?_
]

[Illustration:

  _Manicuring is simply a screaming success. Two operators are
    compulsory. For Eve cannot trust Evelyn or Evelinda, and neither of
    them can trust Eve alone in the dim recesses of that department_
]

[Illustration:

  _But success brings as usual trials in its train, and now Aunt Martha
    insists on having her hair curled there dailyâ_

Christmas at Home
and
Amusing.


[Illustration:

  (1) _Eve goes down to Aunt Matilda for Christmas. Her first care is to
    hang up a bunch of mistletoe in a prominent positionâ_
]

[Illustration:

  (2)_âwhich she steadfastly stands under. Alas! naughty old men and
    schoolboys are the only representatives of the male species present
    to take advantage of it_
]

[Illustration:

  (3) _The Christmas dinner is still more depressingâno Adams, no
    excitement. (Note the size of the war plum pudding and the character
    of the drinks)_
]

[Illustration:

  (4) _So Eve says she has had a wire and the next day bids farewell to
    a stern and incredulous aunt_
]

[Illustration:

  (5) _Back in town again, and the dear boys ring up and insist on Eve
    coming to the Savoy for Boxing Day dinner_
]

[Illustration:

  (6) _Here are the dear boys in khaki and blue telephoning. The names,
    from right to left, are (censored by Eve)_
]

[Illustration:

  (7) _And finally here is our little friend, her spirits regained and
    surrounded by her gallant friends in khaki and blue, to whom, on
    behalf of herself and all her dear friend readers, she is wishing
    God-speed, good luck, and a happy and victorious return_
]




Eve and the
New Furs.


[Illustration:

  _Eve is a great admirer of the new voluminous high-collared fur cloak,
    but finds it impossible to seeâmuch less appreciateâthe dinky
    tassels on her new boots_
]

[Illustration:

  _She also finds her friends have the greatest difficulty in
    recognising her, and that Tou-Tou is continually getting lost_
]

[Illustration:

  _Furthermore, these high collars make it necessary for Jack and Tommy
    to feed her when she goes to tea with them at the Savoy. (Doesnât it
    make a pathetic and appealing picture?)_
]

[Illustration:

  _One advantage, however, is that when Johnny Slacker, Mr. Bore, or
    anyone horrid heaves in sight she can retire without danger of
    recognition_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve adores the ferocious masks which adorned the muffs of the truly
    fashionable last winter. But the above tragic incident, which shows
    a convalescent V.C. fainting in sheer terror at the sudden
    appearance of our heroineâand muffâhas considerably shaken her
    pleasure in her hand warmer_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve is âsimply madâ over the way Gertie Millar does her hair in the
    Gollywog song at the Palace Theatre. She tried it, went to the
    theatre, and found herself the centre of interest from all sides and
    abuse from the back_
]




Some Whyâs
and
Wherefores.


[Illustration:

  _The tax on tea and sugar has reduced our poor Eve and Tou-Tou to hot
    water instead of the refreshing cup of tea which formerly cheered
    Eveâs early-morning awakening._
]

[Illustration:

  _Why it is that when Adam has got his oldest clothes on, and has
    neglected to shave the bristles from his clear-cut chin, he always
    meets his most adorable acquaintancesâMiss Wild-Duck, Miss Flirt,
    and Mrs. Darlingâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âWhereas, when he goes out to dine, trÃ¨s bien soignÃ© in his brand-new
    uniformâred tabs anâ allâthis is the sort of party that greets his
    wrathful gaze? (At the particular moment the picture was taken Aunt
    Matildaâs second revoke was passing unnoticed in the pleasant hum of
    conversation)_
]

[Illustration:

  _Why, also, that on the rare occasions when Eveâs oft-quoted but
    distant cousin, the Countess of Crimp, takes her out for a drive,
    the streets are empty of envious friends or impressed tradesmenâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âAnd that the dear Duchess of Bohemia insists on spending the whole
    of their mutual time in the obscurity of a âmovieâ theatreâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âWhereas when Cousin Tom from the country, with absolute sartorial
    indifference to the conventions of London, induces her to drive out
    in his second-hand Ford, Eve meets and sees everyone she has been
    trying to impress favourably for seasons past?_
]




A
Matrimonial
Puzzleâ

âand Eve
as a
Chaperone.


[Illustration:

  _This is Eve congratulating her two dear friendsâMiss Verry-Pretty and
    Miss Plainâon their engagements. She is expressing the usual frantic
    anxiety to meet the happy fiancÃ©s_
]

[Illustration:

  _She meets them, and wonders again for the nth time why it is that the
    pretty girls are nearly always captured by theâwellâordinary-looking
    men, while those less favoured by Nature so often bag veritable
    Adonises_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve, burdened with the responsibilities of her unmarried sisters,
    Evelyn and Evelinda, is always endeavouring to get them suitably
    paired. She finds it very annoying that when she takes them out to
    dine with her very highly respectable cousin, the Countess of Crimp,
    they meet so many people like Mr. Snob, Captain Auction-Bridge, and
    Mr. Toady_
]

[Illustration:

  _Whereas when she has tucked her little charges safely away in bed and
    flies out for a little relaxation to a naughty night clubâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âShe meets Lord Knut, Reggie Hardcash, and all those very gilded and
    eligible young men who would lead Evelyn and Evelinda to the altar
    in so suitableâand goldenâa fashion_
]




âAnd Yet
More
Whyâs.


[Illustration:

  _Adam insists on Eve being revaccinated. Eve retorts that it canât be
    done while the fashions prevent you having any sleeves in your
    evening dresses. Adam replies, âHave it done on the leg, then!â But
    Eve, more in sorrow than in anger, is saying, âHow can I show my
    legs to a doctor man!â_
]

[Illustration:

  _Why is it so many peopleâs telephones are in the hall or some equally
    public place? This is what Eve feels like when Captain Perfect
    Spooner rings her up at a friendâs house_
]

[Illustration:

  _Why is it when most married men are simply dying to be âcalledâ
    anywhereâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âA short-sighted Government has called up all the single men who are
    so badly needed at home and enjoy life so unmistakably?_
]

[Illustration:

  _This is how trench life appeals to them respectively. The married men
    are on the right. (We must explain that the bachelor warriors on the
    left are not petrified with terror, but only agitated in thinking of
    the dear girls they left behind)_
]




Eve at a
Dinner Partyâ


[Illustration:

  _This is one of Eveâs great moments in the dayânamely, arriving last
    at a big dinner party. She knows full well the effect of this tardy
    comingâthis bursting upon a collection of delighted if hungry men
    and curious and envious womenâinstead of trickling in with the
    others at the proper time_
]

[Illustration:

  _But the above manÅuvre is a very catching habit, and each little Eve,
    anxious not to be the first to arrive, delays the hour of dining.
    Here we see a vivid picture of a hostess and her male guests sharing
    the knowledge that the soup is cold and the dinner going to blazes_
]

[Illustration:

  _Eve has suffered overmuch lately from Aunt Matilda and Major Bore, so
    in a spirit of devilish revenge she brings them together in a little
    party Ã  trois and tells each of them that the other is very deaf.
    The consequence was that they screamed away at each other until
    their tiresome voices were stilled for an appreciable period_
]




âand With Our
Gallant Airmen.


[Illustration:

  _Eve receives an invitation from a unit of that most attractive and
    gallant body of men, the Royal Flying Corps. She is intensely
    excited and rushes off to see them_
]

[Illustration:

  _She finds that the âfeelingâ between woman and woman is nothing
    compared with that existing between members of the two sections of
    flying men. In the picture the gallant observer is saying, âWhat!
    Lunching with a beastly pilot? We always look upon âem as mere
    chauffeurs, Eve, dearââ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âWhereas, the intrepid pilot at luncheon remarked, âI shouldnât get
    too thick with those observer fellers, Eve; we only regard âem as
    bally luggage.â (Eve had to put the wings on the wrong side of the
    chest to show them)_
]




Eve Goes
on to a
Farmâ


[Illustration:

  _Eve, tired of the tension of war anxiety in town, determines to join
    the army of farmworkers. She and Adam therefore journey to Mudshire
    and offer their services to Farmer Giles. He suggests that they
    should commence by looking after the lambs, which pleased Eve
    immensely, as it meant a journey to town to procure a ducky little
    Watteau shepherdess gown. The lambs were hardly less affected than
    Farmer Giles._
]

[Illustration:

  _Eveâs artistic sense is deeply offended by the bizarre, not to say
    early-Victorian, markings of the cows; however, a judicious
    application of paints transformed them into ornamental as well as
    useful members of the community. Farmer Gilesâs hair is, you will
    observe, rising in horror and pushing his hat of his head. (Eve
    canât draw cowsâ legs; hasnât she got out of it cleverly?)_
]




âTo Help the Labour-denuded
Farmer.


[Illustration:

  _After experimenting in pretty but amorous poultry Eve is here seen
    ruthlessly banishing them from her rural Paradise; for, as she truly
    says, âthey set such a bad example to the servantsâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _Adam decided to attend to the little ducks. He does so, and Eve
    prudently decides toâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âAbandon Farmer Giles at once, and she returns with a chastened and
    apologetic Adam to London. The animals in the picture are those
    which Eve made pets of at the farm, and which she simply couldnât
    bear to part with. So she is taking the poor darlings with her_
]




Eve
Appears
in
âTinaââ


[Illustration:

  _Eve, like Byron, wakes up one morning to find herself famous, as the
    Adelphi Theatre has made a screaming success over an âEveâ number.
    Here she is, with an equally excited and palpitating Tou-Tou,
    dashing to the theatre to book seats_
]

[Illustration:

  _This is the âorrible press outside the box office, which is besieged
    by khaki and blueâwho do the most of the pressinââMiss Wild-Duck,
    Miss Darling, and all the little Eves who appeared in the spring
    like the snowdrops_
]




âAt the Adelphi Theatre.


[Illustration:

  _Here is dear Phyllis Dare singing the song, also Tou-Tou, who made
    straight for the stage when the play commenced, and some gallant
    heroes, who see their old but elusive friend materialised at last_
]

[Illustration:

  _All this theatrical publicity has caused Eveâs head to swell right
    out of her collar. In the first glow of fame she feels she can treat
    Aunt Matilda, Miss Gush, and the Bore brothers with the indifference
    she has so long suppressed_
]




The Death
of Tou-Tou.


[Illustration:

  _Now this is the terrible tragedy of Tou-TouâEve discovereth him
    imbibing of strong liquorsâand in war time too_
]

[Illustration:

  _So she took the delinquent to hear Sir Edward Clarkeâs grave lecture
    wherein he urged the clergy to set an example to the country by
    giving up all intoxicants. Tou-Touâs disgust is evident. Owing to
    lack of space we have only room to show Sir Edwardâs impressive
    legs_
]

[Illustration:

  _Overcome by Sir Edwardâs eloquence, Eve takes Tou-Tou to the police
    station to sign the pledge_
]

[Illustration:

  _Tou-Tou, accustomed to sly sips of port, stands the monotony of life
    for some time, but suddenly breaks out and enters on a career of
    âfrightfulness,â which, as is seen in the picture, thoroughly upsets
    his mistress. The sad result of this outburst is seen in the
    right-hand corner of our page._
]

[Illustration:

  _A number of tiny dances were given this springtime for the sake of
    the dear boys on leave. Hundreds of years ago, before the war, Eve
    used to get her dance invitations in this way on formal and
    ceremonial cards. But nowadays they are conveyed in much happier
    fashion; for instanceâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âReggie (on leave): âHello! Hello, Eve! Just back, old girl, and a
    few of us want to strafe some bubbly tonight, so weâve borrowed a
    house, and weâre givinâ a hop. Roll up with a few âcheeries,â and
    bring a bottle with you in case the supply dries upâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _The classical picture on the left represents the pre-war Adam taking
    a demure Eve away from her watchdog for a graceful waltz. On the
    right you see the modern, cheerful, and unchaperoned conditions.
    (The Adams and Reggies donât really dance in uniforms and spurs, but
    Eve likes drawing them like that)_

War-time
Dances.


[Illustration:

  _The arrival at âthe ballâ in the old days. Haughty wall-propping men,
    and little Eves wondering whether they were going to get off and
    detach one of the aforesaid males from his customary support, or
    also decorate the side benchesâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âBut nowadays at âthe partyâ each little Eve takes her own young
    manâsometimes twoâwith whom she spends the greater part of a
    delightful evening, so sheâs happy, heâs happy, and chaperones,
    safely ensconced in bed or at the bridge table, are happy tooâ_
]

[Illustration:

  _âWhile the final breakfast-supper, when a raid is made on the kitchen
    to see what can be found, and Reggie or Billy makes the most divine
    omelettes in the fish saucepan, provides a worthy finish to a
    delightful evening, which keeps many a festive on-leaver out of
    mischief_

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
