PREFACE.


THE âBAB BALLADSâ appeared originally in the columns of âFUN,â when that
periodical was under the editorship of the late TOM HOOD.  They were
subsequently republished in two volumes, one called âTHE BAB BALLADS,â
the other âMORE BAB BALLADS.â  The period during which they were written
extended over some three or four years; many, however, were composed
hastily, and under the discomforting necessity of having to turn out a
quantity of lively verse by a certain day in every week.  As it seemed to
me (and to others) that the volumes were disfigured by the presence of
these hastily written impostors, I thought it better to withdraw from
both volumes such Ballads as seemed to show evidence of carelessness or
undue haste, and to publish the remainder in the compact form under which
they are now presented to the reader.

It may interest some to know that the first of the series, âThe Yarn of
the _Nancy Bell_,â was originally offered to âPUNCH,ââto which I was, at
that time, an occasional contributor.  It was, however, declined by the
then Editor, on the ground that it was âtoo cannibalistic for his
readersâ tastes.â

CAPTAIN REECE.


   OF all the ships upon the blue,
   No ship contained a better crew
   Than that of worthy CAPTAIN REECE,
   Commanding of _The Mantelpiece_.

   He was adored by all his men,
   For worthy CAPTAIN REECE, R.N.,
   Did all that lay within him to
   Promote the comfort of his crew.

   If ever they were dull or sad,
   Their captain danced to them like mad,
   Or told, to make the time pass by,
   Droll legends of his infancy.

   A feather bed had every man,
   Warm slippers and hot-water can,
   Brown windsor from the captainâs store,
   A valet, too, to every four.

   Did they with thirst in summer burn,
   Lo, seltzogenes at every turn,
   And on all very sultry days
   Cream ices handed round on trays.

   Then currant wine and ginger pops
   Stood handily on all the âtops;â
   And also, with amusement rife,
   A âZoetrope, or Wheel of Life.â

   New volumes came across the sea
   From MISTER MUDIEâS libraree;
   _The Times_ and _Saturday Review_
   Beguiled the leisure of the crew.

   Kind-hearted CAPTAIN REECE, R.N.,
   Was quite devoted to his men;
   In point of fact, good CAPTAIN REECE
   Beatified _The Mantelpiece_.

   One summer eve, at half-past ten,
   He said (addressing all his men):
   âCome, tell me, please, what I can do
   To please and gratify my crew.

   âBy any reasonable plan
   Iâll make you happy if I can;
   My own convenience count as _nil_:
   It is my duty, and I will.â

   Then up and answered WILLIAM LEE
   (The kindly captainâs coxswain he,
   A nervous, shy, low-spoken man),
   He cleared his throat and thus began:

   âYou have a daughter, CAPTAIN REECE,
   Ten female cousins and a niece,
   A Ma, if what Iâm told is true,
   Six sisters, and an aunt or two.

   âNow, somehow, sir, it seems to me,
   More friendly-like we all should be,
   If you united of âem to
   Unmarried members of the crew.

   âIf youâd ameliorate our life,
   Let each select from them a wife;
   And as for nervous me, old pal,
   Give me your own enchanting gal!â

   Good CAPTAIN REECE, that worthy man,
   Debated on his coxswainâs plan:
   âI quite agree,â he said, âO BILL;
   It is my duty, and I will.

   âMy daughter, that enchanting gurl,
   Has just been promised to an Earl,
   And all my other familee
   To peers of various degree.

   âBut what are dukes and viscounts to
   The happiness of all my crew?
   The word I gave you Iâll fulfil;
   It is my duty, and I will.

   âAs you desire it shall befall,
   Iâll settle thousands on you all,
   And I shall be, despite my hoard,
   The only bachelor on board.â

   The boatswain of _The Mantelpiece_,
   He blushed and spoke to CAPTAIN REECE:
   âI beg your honourâs leave,â he said;
   âIf you would wish to go and wed,

   âI have a widowed mother who
   Would be the very thing for youâ
   She long has loved you from afar:
   She washes for you, CAPTAIN R.â

   The Captain saw the dame that dayâ
   Addressed her in his playful wayâ
   âAnd did it want a wedding ring?
   It was a tempting ickle sing!

   âWell, well, the chaplain I will seek,
   Weâll all be married this day week
   At yonder church upon the hill;
   It is my duty, and I will!â

   The sisters, cousins, aunts, and niece,
   And widowed Ma of CAPTAIN REECE,
   Attended there as they were bid;
   It was their duty, and they did.




THE RIVAL CURATES.


   LIST while the poet trolls
      Of MR. CLAYTON HOOPER,
   Who had a cure of souls
      At Spiffton-extra-Sooper.

   He lived on curds and whey,
      And daily sang their praises,
   And then heâd go and play
      With buttercups and daisies.

   Wild croquÃªt HOOPER banned,
      And all the sports of Mammon,
   He warred with cribbage, and
      He exorcised backgammon.

   His helmet was a glance
      That spoke of holy gladness;
   A saintly smile his lance;
      His shield a tear of sadness.

   His Vicar smiled to see
      This armour on him buckled:
   With pardonable glee
      He blessed himself and chuckled.

   âIn mildness to abound
      My curateâs sole design is;
   In all the country round
      Thereâs none so mild as mine is!â

   And HOOPER, disinclined
      His trumpet to be blowing,
   Yet didnât think youâd find
      A milder curate going.

   A friend arrived one day
      At Spiffton-extra-Sooper,
   And in this shameful way
      He spoke to Mr. HOOPER:

   âYou think your famous name
      For mildness canât be shaken,
   That none can blot your fameâ
      But, HOOPER, youâre mistaken!

   âYour mind is not as blank
      As that of HOPLEY PORTER,
   Who holds a curateâs rank
      At Assesmilk-cum-Worter.

   â_He_ plays the airy flute,
      And looks depressed and blighted,
   Doves round about him âtoot,â
      And lambkins dance delighted.

   â_He_ labours more than you
      At worsted work, and frames it;
   In old maidsâ albums, too,
      Sticks seaweedâyes, and names it!â

   The tempter said his say,
      Which pierced him like a needleâ
   He summoned straight away
      His sexton and his beadle.

   (These men were men who could
      Hold liberal opinions:
   On Sundays they were goodâ
      On week-days they were minions.)

   âTo HOPLEY PORTER go,
      Your fare I will afford youâ
   Deal him a deadly blow,
      And blessings shall reward you.

   âBut stayâI do not like
      Undue assassination,
   And so before you strike,
      Make this communication:

   âIâll give him this one chanceâ
      If heâll more gaily bear him,
   Play croquÃªt, smoke, and dance,
      I willingly will spare him.â

   They went, those minions true,
      To Assesmilk-cum-Worter,
   And told their errand to
      The REVEREND HOPLEY PORTER.

   âWhat?â said that reverend gent,
      âDance through my hours of leisure?
   Smoke?âbathe myself with scent?â
      Play croquÃªt?  Oh, with pleasure!

   âWear all my hair in curl?
      Stand at my door and winkâsoâ
   At every passing girl?
      My brothers, I should think so!

   âFor years Iâve longed for some
      Excuse for this revulsion:
   Now that excuse has comeâ
      I do it on compulsion!!!â

   He smoked and winked awayâ
      This REVEREND HOPLEY PORTERâ
   The deuce there was to pay
      At Assesmilk-cum-Worter.

   And HOOPER holds his ground,
      In mildness daily growingâ
   They think him, all around,
      The mildest curate going.




ONLY A DANCING GIRL.


   ONLY a dancing girl,
      With an unromantic style,
   With borrowed colour and curl,
      With fixed mechanical smile,
      With many a hackneyed wile,
   With ungrammatical lips,
   And corns that mar her trips.

   Hung from the âfliesâ in air,
      She acts a palpable lie,
   Sheâs as little a fairy there
      As unpoetical I!
      I hear you asking, Whyâ
   Why in the world I sing
   This tawdry, tinselled thing?

   No airy fairy she,
      As she hangs in arsenic green
   From a highly impossible tree
      In a highly impossible scene
      (Herself not over-clean).
   For fays donât suffer, Iâm told,
   From bunions, coughs, or cold.

   And stately dames that bring
      Their daughters there to see,
   Pronounce the âdancing thingâ
      No better than she should be,
      With her skirt at her shameful knee,
   And her painted, tainted phiz:
   Ah, matron, which of us is?

   (And, in sooth, it oft occurs
      That while these matrons sigh,
   Their dresses are lower than hers,
      And sometimes half as high;
      And their hair is hair they buy,
   And they use their glasses, too,
   In a way sheâd blush to do.)

   But change her gold and green
      For a coarse merino gown,
   And see her upon the scene
      Of her home, when coaxing down
      Her drunken fatherâs frown,
   In his squalid cheerless den:
   Sheâs a fairy truly, then!




TO A LITTLE MAID
BY A POLICEMAN.


   COME with me, little maid,
   Nay, shrink not, thus afraidâ
      Iâll harm thee not!
   Fly not, my love, from meâ
   I have a home for theeâ
      A fairy grot,
            Where mortal eye
            Can rarely pry,
   There shall thy dwelling be!

   List to me, while I tell
   The pleasures of that cell,
      Oh, little maid!
   What though its couch be rude,
   Homely the only food
      Within its shade?
            No thought of care
            Can enter there,
   No vulgar swain intrude!

   Come with me, little maid,
   Come to the rocky shade
      I love to sing;
   Live with us, maiden rareâ
   Come, for we âwantâ thee there,
      Thou elfin thing,
            To work thy spell,
            In some cool cell
   In stately Pentonville!




THE TROUBADOUR.


   A TROUBADOUR he played
      Without a castle wall,
   Within, a hapless maid
      Responded to his call.

   âOh, willow, woe is me!
      Alack and well-a-day!
   If I were only free
      Iâd hie me far away!â

   Unknown her face and name,
      But this he knew right well,
   The maidenâs wailing came
      From out a dungeon cell.

   A hapless woman lay
      Within that dungeon grimâ
   That fact, Iâve heard him say,
      Was quite enough for him.

   âI will not sit or lie,
      Or eat or drink, I vow,
   Till thou art free as I,
      Or I as pent as thou.â

   Her tears then ceased to flow,
      Her wails no longer rang,
   And tuneful in her woe
      The prisoned maiden sang:

   âOh, stranger, as you play,
      I recognize your touch;
   And all that I can say
      Is, thank you very much.â

   He seized his clarion straight,
      And blew thereat, until
   A warden oped the gate.
      âOh, what might be your will?â

   âIâve come, Sir Knave, to see
      The master of these halls:
   A maid unwillingly
      Lies prisoned in their walls.ââ

   With barely stifled sigh
      That porter drooped his head,
   With teardrops in his eye,
      âA many, sir,â he said.

   He stayed to hear no more,
      But pushed that porter by,
   And shortly stood before
      SIR HUGH DE PECKHAM RYE.

   SIR HUGH he darkly frowned,
      âWhat would you, sir, with me?â
   The troubadour he downed
      Upon his bended knee.

   âIâve come, DE PECKHAM RYE,
      To do a Christian task;
   You ask me what would I?
      It is not much I ask.

   âRelease these maidens, sir,
      Whom you dominion oâerâ
   Particularly her
      Upon the second floor.

   âAnd if you donât, my lordââ
      He here stood bolt upright,
   And tapped a tailorâs swordâ
      âCome out, you cad, and fight!â

   SIR HUGH he calledâand ran
      The warden from the gate:
   âGo, show this gentleman
      The maid in Forty-eight.â

   By many a cell they past,
      And stopped at length before
   A portal, bolted fast:
      The man unlocked the door.

   He called inside the gate
      With coarse and brutal shout,
   âCome, step it, Forty-eight!â
      And Forty-eight stepped out.

   âThey gets it pretty hot,
      The maidens what we cotchâ
   Two years this ladyâs got
      For collaring a wotch.â

   âOh, ah!âindeedâI see,â
      The troubadour exclaimedâ
   âIf I may make so free,
      How is this castle named?â

   The wardenâs eyelids fill,
      And sighing, he replied,
   âOf gloomy Pentonville
      This is the female side!â

   The minstrel did not wait
      The Warden stout to thank,
   But recollected straight
      Heâd business at the Bank.




FERDINANDO AND ELVIRA;
OR, THE GENTLE PIEMAN.


PART I.


   AT a pleasant evening party I had taken down to supper
   One whom I will call ELVIRA, and we talked of love and TUPPER,

   MR. TUPPER and the Poets, very lightly with them dealing,
   For Iâve always been distinguished for a strong poetic feeling.

   Then we let off paper crackers, each of which contained a motto,
   And she listened while I read them, till her mother told her not to.

   Then she whispered, âTo the ball-room we had better, dear, be walking;
   If we stop down here much longer, really people will be talking.â

   There were noblemen in coronets, and military cousins,
   There were captains by the hundred, there were baronets by dozens.

   Yet she heeded not their offers, but dismissed them with a blessing,
   Then she let down all her back hair, which had taken long in dressing.

   Then she had convulsive sobbings in her agitated throttle,
   Then she wiped her pretty eyes and smelt her pretty smelling-bottle.

   So I whispered, âDear ELVIRA, say,âwhat can the matter be with you?
   Does anything youâve eaten, darling POPSY, disagree with you?â

   But spite of all I said, her sobs grew more and more distressing,
   And she tore her pretty back hair, which had taken long in dressing.

   Then she gazed upon the carpet, at the ceiling, then above me,
   And she whispered, âFERDINANDO, do you really, _really_ love me?â

   âLove you?â said I, then I sighed, and then I gazed upon her sweetlyâ
   For I think I do this sort of thing particularly neatly.

   âSend me to the Arctic regions, or illimitable azure,
   On a scientific goose-chase, with my COXWELL or my GLAISHER!

   âTell me whither I may hie meâtell me, dear one, that I may knowâ
   Is it up the highest Andes? down a horrible volcano?â

   But she said, âIt isnât polar bears, or hot volcanic grottoes:
   Only find out who it is that writes those lovely cracker mottoes!â




PART II.


   âTell me, HENRY WADSWORTH, ALFRED POET CLOSE, or MISTER TUPPER,
   Do you write the bon bon mottoes my ELVIRA pulls at supper?â

   But HENRY WADSWORTH smiled, and said he had not had that honour;
   And ALFRED, too, disclaimed the words that told so much upon her.

   âMISTER MARTIN TUPPER, POET CLOSE, I beg of you inform us;â
   But my question seemed to throw them both into a rage enormous.

   MISTER CLOSE expressed a wish that he could only get anigh to me;
   And MISTER MARTIN TUPPER sent the following reply to me:

   âA fool is bent upon a twig, but wise men dread a bandit,ââ
   Which I know was very clever; but I didnât understand it.

   Seven weary years I wanderedâPatagonia, China, Norway,
   Till at last I sank exhausted at a pastrycook his doorway.

   There were fuchsias and geraniums, and daffodils and myrtle,
   So I entered, and I ordered half a basin of mock turtle.

   He was plump and he was chubby, he was smooth and he was rosy,
   And his little wife was pretty and particularly cosy.

   And he chirped and sang, and skipped about, and laughed with laughter
   heartyâ
   He was wonderfully active for so very stout a party.

   And I said, âO gentle pieman, why so very, very merry?
   Is it purity of conscience, or your one-and-seven sherry?â

   But he answered, âIâm so happyâno profession could be dearerâ
   If I am not humming âTra! la! la!â Iâm singing âTirer, lirer!â

   âFirst I go and make the patties, and the puddings, and the jellies,
   Then I make a sugar bird-cage, which upon a table swell is;

   âThen I polish all the silver, which a supper-table lacquers;
   Then I write the pretty mottoes which you find inside the crackers.ââ

   âFound at last!â I madly shouted.  âGentle pieman, you astound me!â
   Then I waved the turtle soup enthusiastically round me.

   And I shouted and I danced until heâd quite a crowd around himâ
   And I rushed away exclaiming, âI have found him!  I have found him!â

   And I heard the gentle pieman in the road behind me trilling,
   ââTira, lira!â stop him, stop him!  âTra! la! la!â the soupâs a
   shilling!â

   But until I reached ELVIRAâS home, I never, never waited,
   And ELVIRA to her FERDINANDâS irrevocably mated!




TO MY BRIDE
(WHOEVER SHE MAY BE.)


   OH! little maid!â(I do not know your name
      Or who you are, so, as a safe precaution
   Iâll add)âOh, buxom widow! married dame!
      (As one of these must be your present portion)
         Listen, while I unveil prophetic lore for you,
         And sing the fate that Fortune has in store for you.

   Youâll marry soonâwithin a year or twainâ
      A bachelor of _circa_ two and thirty:
   Tall, gentlemanly, but extremely plain,
      And when youâre intimate, youâll call him âBERTIE.â
         Neatâdresses well; his temper has been classified
         As hasty; but heâs very quickly pacified.

   Youâll find him working mildly at the Bar,
      After a touch at two or three professions,
   From easy affluence extremely far,
      A brief or two on Circuitââsoupâ at Sessions;
         A pound or two from whist and backing horses,
         And, say three hundred from his own resources.

   Quiet in harness; free from serious vice,
      His faults are not particularly shady,
   Youâll never find him â_shy_ââfor, once or twice
      Already, heâs been driven by a lady,
         Who parts with himâperhaps a poor excuse for himâ
         Because she hasnât any further use for him.

   Oh! bride of mineâtall, dumpy, dark, or fair!
      Oh! widowâwife, maybe, or blushing maiden,
   Iâve told _your_ fortune; solved the gravest care
      With which your mind has hitherto been laden.
         Iâve prophesied correctly, never doubt it;
         Now tell me mineâand please be quick about it!

   Youâonly youâcan tell me, anâ you will,
      To whom Iâm destined shortly to be mated,
   Will she run up a heavy _modisteâs_ bill?
      If so, I want to hear her income stated
         (This is a point which interests me greatly).
         To quote the bard, âOh! have I seen her lately?â

   Say, must I wait till husband number one
      Is comfortably stowed away at Woking?
   How is her hair most usually done?
      And tell me, please, will she object to smoking?
         The colour of her eyes, too, you may mention:
         Come, Sibyl, prophesyâIâm all attention.




SIR MACKLIN.


   OF all the youths I ever saw
      None were so wicked, vain, or silly,
   So lost to shame and Sabbath law,
      As worldly TOM, and BOB, and BILLY.

   For every Sabbath day they walked
      (Such was their gay and thoughtless natur)
   In parks or gardens, where they talked
      From three to six, or even later.

   SIR MACKLIN was a priest severe
      In conduct and in conversation,
   It did a sinner good to hear
      Him deal in ratiocination.

   He could in every action show
      Some sin, and nobody could doubt him.
   He argued high, he argued low,
      He also argued round about him.

   He wept to think each thoughtless youth
      Contained of wickedness a skinful,
   And burnt to teach the awful truth,
      That walking out on Sundayâs sinful.

   âOh, youths,â said he, âI grieve to find
      The course of life youâve been and hit onâ
   Sit down,â said he, âand never mind
      The pennies for the chairs you sit on.

   âMy opening head is âKensington,â
      How walking there the sinner hardens,
   Which when I have enlarged upon,
      I go to âSecondlyââits âGardens.â

   âMy âThirdlyâ comprehendeth âHyde,â
      Of Secresy the guilts and shameses;
   My âFourthlyâââParkââits verdure wideâ
      My âFifthlyâ comprehends âSt. Jamesâs.â

   âThat matter settled, I shall reach
      The âSixthlyâ in my solemn tether,
   And show that what is true of each,
      Is also true of all, together.

   âThen I shall demonstrate to you,
      According to the rules of WHATELY,
   That what is true of all, is true
      Of each, considered separately.â

   In lavish stream his accents flow,
      TOM, BOB, and BILLY dare not flout him;
   He argued high, he argued low,
      He also argued round about him.

   âHa, ha!â he said, âyou loathe your ways,
      You writhe at these my words of warning,
   In agony your hands you raise.â
      (And so they did, for they were yawning.)

   To âTwenty-firstlyâ on they go,
      The lads do not attempt to scout him;
   He argued high, he argued low,
      He also argued round about him.

   âHo, ho!â he cries, âyou bow your crestsâ
      My eloquence has set you weeping;
   In shame you bend upon your breasts!â
      (And so they did, for they were sleeping.)

   He proved them thisâhe proved them thatâ
      This good but wearisome ascetic;
   He jumped and thumped upon his hat,
      He was so very energetic.

   His Bishop at this moment chanced
      To pass, and found the road encumbered;
   He noticed how the Churchman danced,
      And how his congregation slumbered.

   The hundred and eleventh head
      The priest completed of his stricture;
   âOh, bosh!â the worthy Bishop said,
      And walked him off as in the picture.




THE YARN OF THE âNANCY BELL.â {44}


   âTWAS on the shores that round our coast
      From Deal to Ramsgate span,
   That I found alone on a piece of stone
      An elderly naval man.

   His hair was weedy, his beard was long,
      And weedy and long was he,
   And I heard this wight on the shore recite,
      In a singular minor key:

   âOh, I am a cook and a captain bold,
      And the mate of the _Nancy_ brig,
   And a boâsun tight, and a midshipmite,
      And the crew of the captainâs gig.â

   And he shook his fists and he tore his hair,
      Till I really felt afraid,
   For I couldnât help thinking the man had been drinking,
      And so I simply said:

   âOh, elderly man, itâs little I know
      Of the duties of men of the sea,
   And Iâll eat my hand if I understand
      However you can be

   âAt once a cook, and a captain bold,
      And the mate of the _Nancy_ brig,
   And a boâsun tight, and a midshipmite,
      And the crew of the captainâs gig.â

   Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which
      Is a trick all seamen larn,
   And having got rid of a thumping quid,
      He spun this painful yarn:

   ââTwas in the good ship _Nancy Bell_
      That we sailed to the Indian Sea,
   And there on a reef we come to grief,
      Which has often occurred to me.

   âAnd pretty nigh all the crew was drowned
      (There was seventy-seven oâ soul),
   And only ten of the _Nancyâs_ men
      Said âHere!â to the muster-roll.

   âThere was me and the cook and the captain bold,
      And the mate of the _Nancy_ brig,
   And the boâsun tight, and a midshipmite,
      And the crew of the captainâs gig.

   âFor a month weâd neither wittles nor drink,
      Till a-hungry we did feel,
   So we drawed a lot, and, accordinâ shot
      The captain for our meal.

   âThe next lot fell to the _Nancyâs_ mate,
      And a delicate dish he made;
   Then our appetite with the midshipmite
      We seven survivors stayed.

   âAnd then we murdered the boâsun tight,
      And he much resembled pig;
   Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,
      On the crew of the captainâs gig.

   âThen only the cook and me was left,
      And the delicate question, âWhich
   Of us two goes to the kettle?â arose,
      And we argued it out as sich.

   âFor I loved that cook as a brother, I did,
      And the cook he worshipped me;
   But weâd both be blowed if weâd either be stowed
      In the other chapâs hold, you see.

   ââIâll be eat if you dines off me,â says TOM;
      âYes, that,â says I, âyouâll be,â
   âIâm boiled if I die, my friend,â quoth I;
      And âExactly so,â quoth he.

   âSays he, âDear JAMES, to murder me
      Were a foolish thing to do,
   For donât you see that you canât cook _me_,
      While I canâand willâcook _you_!â

   âSo he boils the water, and takes the salt
      And the pepper in portions true
   (Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot.
      And some sage and parsley too.

   ââCome here,â says he, with a proper pride,
      Which his smiling features tell,
   ââT will soothing be if I let you see
      How extremely nice youâll smell.â

   âAnd he stirred it round and round and round,
      And he sniffed at the foaming froth;
   When I ups with his heels, and smothers his squeals
      In the scum of the boiling broth.

   âAnd I eat that cook in a week or less,
      Andâas I eating be
   The last of his chops, why, I almost drops,
      For a wessel in sight I see!

                                 * * * *

   âAnd I never larf, and I never smile,
      And I never lark nor play,
   But sit and croak, and a single joke
      I haveâwhich is to say:

   âOh, I am a cook and a captain bold,
      And the mate of the _Nancy_ brig,
   And a boâsun tight, and a midshipmite,
      And the crew of the captainâs gig!ââ




THE BISHOP OF RUM-TI-FOO.


   FROM east and south the holy clan
   Of Bishops gathered to a man;
   To Synod, called Pan-Anglican,
      In flocking crowds they came.
   Among them was a Bishop, who
   Had lately been appointed to
   The balmy isle of Rum-ti-Foo,
      And PETER was his name.

   His peopleâtwenty-three in sumâ
   They played the eloquent tum-tum,
   And lived on scalps served up, in rumâ
      The only sauce they knew.
   When first good BISHOP PETER came
   (For PETER was that Bishopâs name),
   To humour them, he did the same
      As they of Rum-ti-Foo.

   His flock, Iâve often heard him tell,
   (His name was PETER) loved him well,
   And, summoned by the sound of bell,
      In crowds together came.
   âOh, massa, why you go away?
   Oh, MASSA PETER, please to stay.â
   (They called him PETER, people say,
      Because it was his name.)

   He told them all good boys to be,
   And sailed away across the sea,
   At London Bridge that Bishop he
      Arrived one Tuesday night;
   And as that night he homeward strode
   To his Pan-Anglican abode,
   He passed along the Borough Road,
      And saw a gruesome sight.

   He saw a crowd assembled round
   A person dancing on the ground,
   Who straight began to leap and bound
      With all his might and main.
   To see that dancing man he stopped,
   Who twirled and wriggled, skipped and hopped,
   Then down incontinently dropped,
      And then sprang up again.

   The Bishop chuckled at the sight.
   âThis style of dancing would delight
   A simple Rum-ti-Foozleite.
      Iâll learn it if I can,
   To please the tribe when I get back.â
   He begged the man to teach his knack.
   âRight Reverend Sir, in half a crack!â
      Replied that dancing man.

   The dancing man he worked away,
   And taught the Bishop every dayâ
   The dancer skipped like any fayâ
      Good PETER did the same.
   The Bishop buckled to his task,
   With _battements_, and _pas de basque_.
   (Iâll tell you, if you care to ask,
      That PETER was his name.)

   âCome, walk like this,â the dancer said,
   âStick out your toesâstick in your head,
   Stalk on with quick, galvanic treadâ
      Your fingers thus extend;
   The attitudeâs considered quaint.â
   The weary Bishop, feeling faint,
   Replied, âI do not say it ainât,
      But âTime!â my Christian friend!â

   âWe now proceed to something newâ
   Dance as the PAYNES and LAURIS do,
   Like thisâone, twoâone, twoâone, two.â
      The Bishop, never proud,
   But in an overwhelming heat
   (His name was PETER, I repeat)
   Performed the PAYNE and LAURI feat,
      And puffed his thanks aloud.

   Another game the dancer plannedâ
   âJust take your ankle in your hand,
   And try, my lord, if you can standâ
      Your body stiff and stark.
   If, when revisiting your see,
   You learnt to hop on shoreâlike meâ
   The novelty would striking be,
      And must attract remark.â

   âNo,â said the worthy Bishop, âno;
   That is a length to which, I trow,
   Colonial Bishops cannot go.
      You may express surprise
   At finding Bishops deal in prideâ
   But if that trick I ever tried,
   I should appear undignified
      In Rum-ti-Foozleâs eyes.

   âThe islanders of Rum-ti-Foo
   Are well-conducted persons, who
   Approve a joke as much as you,
      And laugh at it as such;
   But if they saw their Bishop land,
   His leg supported in his hand,
   The joke they wouldnât understandâ
      âT would pain them very much!â




THE PRECOCIOUS BABY.
A VERY TRUE TALE.


          (_To be sung to the Air of the_ â_Whistling Oyster_.â)

   AN elderly personâa prophet by tradeâ
            With his quips and tips
            On withered old lips,
   He married a young and a beautiful maid;
            The cunning old blade!
            Though rather decayed,
   He married a beautiful, beautiful maid.

   She was only eighteen, and as fair as could be,
            With her tempting smiles
            And maidenly wiles,
   And he was a trifle past seventy-three:
            Now what she could see
            Is a puzzle to me,
   In a prophet of seventyâseventy-three!

   Of all their acquaintances bidden (or bad)
            With their loud high jinks
            And underbred winks,
   None thought theyâd a family haveâbut they had;
            A dear little lad
            Who drove âem half mad,
   For he turned out a horribly fast little cad.

   For when he was born he astonished all by,
            With their âLaw, dear me!â
            âDid ever you see?â
   Heâd a pipe in his mouth and a glass in his eye,
            A hat all awryâ
            An octagon tieâ
   And a miniatureâminiature glass in his eye.

   He grumbled at wearing a frock and a cap,
            With his âOh, dear, oh!â
            And his âHang it! âoo know!â
   And he turned up his nose at his excellent papâ
            âMy friends, itâs a tap
            Dat is not worf a rap.â
   (Now this was remarkably excellent pap.)

   Heâd chuck his nurse under the chin, and heâd say,
            With his âFal, lal, lalââ
            ââOo doosed fine gal!â
   This shocking precocity drove âem away:
            âA month from to-day
            Is as long as Iâll stayâ
   Then Iâd wish, if you please, for to toddle away.â

   His father, a simple old gentleman, he
            With nursery rhyme
            And âOnce on a time,â
   Would tell him the story of âLittle Bo-P,â
            âSo pretty was she,
            So pretty and wee,
   As pretty, as pretty, as pretty could be.â

   But the babe, with a dig that would startle an ox,
            With his âCâck!  Oh, my!â
            Go along wiz âoo, fie!â
   Would exclaim, âIâm afraid âoo a socking ole fox.â
            Now a father it shocks,
            And it whitens his locks,
   When his little babe calls him a shocking old fox.

   The name of his father heâd couple and pair
            (With his ill-bred laugh,
            And insolent chaff)
   With those of the nursery heroines rareâ
            Virginia the Fair,
            Or Good Goldenhair,
   Till the nuisance was more than a prophet could bear.

   âThereâs Jill and White Catâ (said the bold little brat,
            With his loud, âHa, ha!â)
            ââOo sly ickle Pa!
   Wiz âoo Beauty, Bo-Peep, and âoo Mrs. Jack Sprat!
            Iâve noticed âoo pat
            _My_ pretty White Catâ
   I sink dear mamma ought to know about dat!â

   He early determined to marry and wive,
            For better or worse
            With his elderly nurseâ
   Which the poor little boy didnât live to contrive:
            His hearth didnât thriveâ
            No longer alive,
   He died an enfeebled old dotard at five!

                                  MORAL.

   Now, elderly men of the bachelor crew,
            With wrinkled hose
            And spectacled nose,
   Donât marry at allâyou may take it as true
            If ever you do
            The step you will rue,
   For your babes will be elderlyâelderly too.




TO PHÅBE. {59}


   âGENTLE, modest little flower,
      Sweet epitome of May,
   Love me but for half an hour,
      Love me, love me, little fay.â
   Sentences so fiercely flaming
      In your tiny shell-like ear,
   I should always be exclaiming
      If I loved you, PHÅBE dear.

   âSmiles that thrill from any distance
      Shed upon me while I sing!
   Please ecstaticize existence,
      Love me, oh, thou fairy thing!â
   Words like these, outpouring sadly
      Youâd perpetually hear,
   If I loved you fondly, madly;â
      But I do not, PHÅBE dear.




BAINES CAREW, GENTLEMAN.


   OF all the good attorneys who
      Have placed their names upon the roll,
   But few could equal BAINES CAREW
      For tender-heartedness and soul.

   Wheneâer he heard a tale of woe
      From client A or client B,
   His grief would overcome him so
      Heâd scarce have strength to take his fee.

   It laid him up for many days,
      When duty led him to distrain,
   And serving writs, although it pays,
      Gave him excruciating pain.

   He made out costs, distrained for rent,
      Foreclosed and sued, with moistened eyeâ
   No bill of costs could represent
      The value of such sympathy.

   No charges can approximate
      The worth of sympathy with woe;â
   Although I think I ought to state
      He did his best to make them so.

   Of all the many clients who
      Had mustered round his legal flag,
   No single client of the crew
      Was half so dear as CAPTAIN BAGG.

   Now, CAPTAIN BAGG had bowed him to
      A heavy matrimonial yokeâ
   His wifey had of faults a fewâ
      She never could resist a joke.

   Her chaff at first he meekly bore,
      Till unendurable it grew.
   âTo stop this persecution sore
      I will consult my friend CAREW.

   âAnd when CAREWâS advice Iâve got,
      Divorce _a mensÃ¢_ I shall try.â
   (A legal separationânot
      _A vinculo conjugii_.)

   âOh, BAINES CAREW, my woe Iâve kept
      A secret hitherto, you know;ââ
   (And BAINES CAREW, ESQUIRE, he wept
      To hear that BAGG _had_ any woe.)

   âMy case, indeed, is passing sad.
      My wifeâwhom I considered trueâ
   With brutal conduct drives me mad.â
      âI am appalled,â said BAINES CAREW.

   âWhat! sound the matrimonial knell
      Of worthy people such as these!
   Why was I an attorney?  Wellâ
      Go on to the _sÃ¦vitia_, please.â

   âDomestic bliss has proved my bane,â
      A harder case you never heard,
   My wife (in other matters sane)
      Pretends that Iâm a Dicky bird!

   âShe makes me sing, âToo-whit, too-wee!â
      And stand upon a rounded stick,
   And always introduces me
      To every one as âPretty Dickâ!â

   âOh, dear,â said weeping BAINES CAREW,
      âThis is the direst case I know.â
   âIâm grieved,â said BAGG, âat paining youâ
      To COBB and POLTHERTHWAITE Iâll goâ

   âTo COBBâS cold, calculating ear,
      My gruesome sorrows Iâll impartââ
   âNo; stop,â said BAINES, âIâll dry my tear,
      And steel my sympathetic heart.â

   âShe makes me perch upon a tree,
      Rewarding me with âSweetyânice!â
   And threatens to exhibit me
      With four or five performing mice.â

   âRestrain my tears I wish I couldâ
      (Said BAINES), âI donât know what to do.â
   Said CAPTAIN BAGG, âYouâre very good.â
      âOh, not at all,â said BAINES CAREW.

   âShe makes me fire a gun,â said BAGG;
      âAnd, at a preconcerted word,
   Climb up a ladder with a flag,
      Like any street performing bird.

   âShe places sugar in my wayâ
      In public places calls me âSweet!â
   She gives me groundsel every day,
      And hard canary-seed to eat.â

   âOh, woe! oh, sad! oh, dire to tell!â
      (Said BAINES).  âBe good enough to stop.â
   And senseless on the floor he fell,
      With unpremeditated flop!

   Said CAPTAIN BAGG, âWell, really I
      Am grieved to think it pains you so.
   I thank you for your sympathy;
      But, hang it!âcomeâI say, you know!â

   But BAINES lay flat upon the floor,
      Convulsed with sympathetic sob;â
   The Captain toddled off next door,
      And gave the case to MR. COBB.




THOMAS WINTERBOTTOM HANCE.


   IN all the towns and cities fair
      On Merry Englandâs broad expanse,
   No swordsman ever could compare
      With THOMAS WINTERBOTTOM HANCE.

   The dauntless lad could fairly hew
      A silken handkerchief in twain,
   Divide a leg of mutton tooâ
      And this without unwholesome strain.

   On whole half-sheep, with cunning trick,
      His sabre sometimes heâd employâ
   No bar of lead, however thick,
      Had terrors for the stalwart boy.

   At Dover daily heâd prepare
      To hew and slash, behind, beforeâ
   Which aggravated MONSIEUR PIERRE,
      Who watched him from the Calais shore.

   It caused good PIERRE to swear and dance,
      The sight annoyed and vexed him so;
   He was the bravest man in Franceâ
      He said so, and he ought to know.

   âRegardez donc, ce cochon grosâ
      Ce polisson!  Oh, sacrÃ© bleu!
   Son sabre, son plomb, et ses gigots
      Comme cela mâennuye, enfin, mon Dieu!

   âIl sait que les foulards de soie
      Give no retaliating whackâ
   Les gigots morts nâont pas de quoiâ
      Le plomb donât ever hit you back.â

   But every day the headstrong lad
      Cut lead and mutton more and more;
   And every day poor PIERRE, half mad,
      Shrieked loud defiance from his shore.

   HANCE had a mother, poor and old,
      A simple, harmless village dame,
   Who crowed and clapped as people told
      Of WINTERBOTTOMâS rising fame.

   She said, âIâll be upon the spot
      To see my TOMMYâS sabre-play;â
   And so she left her leafy cot,
      And walked to Dover in a day.

   PIERRE had a doating mother, who
      Had heard of his defiant rage;
   _His_ Ma was nearly ninety-two,
      And rather dressy for her age.

   At HANCEâS doings every morn,
      With sheer delight _his_ mother cried;
   And MONSIEUR PIERREâS contemptuous scorn
      Filled _his_ mamma with proper pride.

   But HANCEâS powers began to failâ
      His constitution was not strongâ
   And PIERRE, who once was stout and hale,
      Grew thin from shouting all day long.

   Their mothers saw them pale and wan,
      Maternal anguish tore each breast,
   And so they met to find a plan
      To set their offspringsâ minds at rest.

   Said MRS. HANCE, âOf course I shrinks
      From bloodshed, maâam, as youâre aware,
   But still theyâd better meet, I thinks.â
      âAssurÃ©ment!â said MADAME PIERRE.

   A sunny spot in sunny France
      Was hit upon for this affair;
   The ground was picked by MRS. HANCE,
      The stakes were pitched by MADAME PIERRE.

   Said MRS. H., âYour work you seeâ
      Go in, my noble boy, and win.â
   âEn garde, mon fils!â said MADAME P.
      âAllons!â  âGo on!â  âEn garde!â  âBegin!â

   (The mothers were of decent size,
      Though not particularly tall;
   But in the sketch that meets your eyes
      Iâve been obliged to draw them small.)

   Loud sneered the doughty man of France,
      âHo! ho!  Ho! ho!  Ha! ha!  Ha! ha!
   The French for âPishââ said THOMAS HANCE.
      Said PIERRE, âLâAnglais, Monsieur, pour âBah.ââ

   Said MRS. H., âCome, one! two! three!â
      Weâre sittinâ here to see all fair.â
   âCâest magnifique!â said MADAME P.,
      âMais, parbleu! ce nâest pas la guerre!â

   âJe scorn un foe si lache que vous,â
      Said PIERRE, the doughty son of France.
   âI fight not coward foe like you!â
      Said our undaunted TOMMY HANCE.

   âThe French for âPooh!ââ our TOMMY cried.
      âLâAnglais pour âVa!ââ the Frenchman crowed.
   And so, with undiminished pride,
      Each went on his respective road.




A DISCONTENTED SUGAR BROKER.


   A GENTLEMAN of City fame
      Now claims your kind attention;
   East India broking was his game,
      His name I shall not mention:
         No one of finely-pointed sense
         Would violate a confidence,
               And shall _I_ go
               And do it?  No!
      His name I shall not mention.

   He had a trusty wife and true,
      And very cosy quarters,
   A manager, a boy or two,
      Six clerks, and seven porters.
         A broker must be doing well
         (As any lunatic can tell)
               Who can employ
               An active boy,
      Six clerks, and seven porters.

   His knocker advertised no dun,
      No losses made him sulky,
   He had one sorrowâonly oneâ
      He was extremely bulky.
         A man must be, I beg to state,
         Exceptionally fortunate
               Who owns his chief
               And only grief
      Isâbeing very bulky.

   âThis load,â heâd say, âI cannot bear;
      Iâm nineteen stone or twenty!
   Henceforward Iâll go in for air
      And exercise in plenty.â
         Most people think that, should it come,
         They can reduce a bulging tum
               To measures fair
               By taking air
      And exercise in plenty.

   In every weather, every day,
      Dry, muddy, wet, or gritty,
   He took to dancing all the way
      From Brompton to the City.
         You do not often get the chance
         Of seeing sugar brokers dance
               From their abode
               In Fulham Road
      Through Brompton to the City.

   He braved the gay and guileless laugh
      Of children with their nusses,
   The loud uneducated chaff
      Of clerks on omnibuses.
         Against all minor things that rack
         A nicely-balanced mind, Iâll back
               The noisy chaff
               And ill-bred laugh
      Of clerks on omnibuses.

   His friends, who heard his money chink,
      And saw the house he rented,
   And knew his wife, could never think
      What made him discontented.
         It never entered their pure minds
         That fads are of eccentric kinds,
               Nor would they own
               That fat alone
      Could make one discontented.

   âYour riches know no kind of pause,
      Your trade is fast advancing;
   You danceâbut not for joy, because
      You weep as you are dancing.
         To dance implies that man is glad,
         To weep implies that man is sad;
               But here are you
               Who do the twoâ
      You weep as you are dancing!â

   His mania soon got noised about
      And into all the papers;
   His size increased beyond a doubt
      For all his reckless capers:
         It may seem singular to you,
         But all his friends admit it trueâ
               The more he found
               His figure round,
      The more he cut his capers.

   His bulk increasedâno matter thatâ
      He tried the more to toss itâ
   He never spoke of it as âfat,â
      But âadipose deposit.â
         Upon my word, it seems to me
         Unpardonable vanity
               (And worse than that)
               To call your fat
      An âadipose deposit.â

   At length his brawny knees gave way,
      And on the carpet sinking,
   Upon his shapeless back he lay
      And kicked away like winking.
         Instead of seeing in his state
         The finger of unswerving Fate,
               He laboured still
               To work his will,
      And kicked away like winking.

   His friends, disgusted with him now,
      Away in silence wendedâ
   I hardly like to tell you how
      This dreadful story ended.
         The shocking sequel to impart,
         I must employ the limnerâs artâ
               If you would know,
               This sketch will show
      How his exertions ended.

                                  MORAL.

   I hate to preachâI hate to prateâ
   âIâm no fanatic croaker,
   But learn contentment from the fate
   Of this East India broker.
   Heâd everything a man of taste
   Could ever want, except a waist;
   And discontent
   His size anent,
   And bootless perseverance blind,
   Completely wrecked the peace of mind
   Of this East India broker.




THE PANTOMIME âSUPERâ TO HIS MASK.


            VAST empty shell!
   Impertinent, preposterous abortion!
            With vacant stare,
            And ragged hair,
   And every feature out of all proportion!
   Embodiment of echoing inanity!
   Excellent type of simpering insanity!
   Unwieldy, clumsy nightmare of humanity!
            I ring thy knell!

            To-night thou diest,
   Beast that destroyâst my heaven-born identity!
            Nine weeks of nights,
            Before the lights,
   Swamped in thine own preposterous nonentity,
   Iâve been ill-treated, cursed, and thrashed diurnally,
   Credited for the smile you wear externallyâ
   I feel disposed to smash thy face, infernally,
            As there thou liest!

            Iâve been thy brain:
   _Iâve_ been the brain that lit thy dull concavity!
            The human race
            Invest _my_ face
   With thine expression of unchecked depravity,
   Invested with a ghastly reciprocity,
   _Iâve_ been responsible for thy monstrosity,
   I, for thy wanton, blundering ferocityâ
            But not again!

            âT is time to toll
   Thy knell, and that of follies pantomimical:
            A nine weeksâ run,
            And thou hast done
   All thou canst do to make thyself inimical.
   Adieu, embodiment of all inanity!
   Excellent type of simpering insanity!
   Unwieldy, clumsy nightmare of humanity!
            Freed is thy soul!

                         (_The Mask respondeth_.)

            Oh! master mine,
   Look thou within thee, ere again ill-using me.
            Art thou aware
            Of nothing there
   Which might abuse thee, as thou art abusing me?
   A brain that mourns _thine_ unredeemed rascality?
   A soul that weeps at _thy_ threadbare morality?
   Both grieving that _their_ individuality
            Is merged in thine?




THE GHOST, THE GALLANT, THE GAEL, AND THE GOBLIN.


   Oâer unreclaimed suburban clays
      Some years ago were hobblinâ
   An elderly ghost of easy ways,
      And an influential goblin.
   The ghost was a sombre spectral shape,
      A fine old five-act fogy,
   The goblin imp, a lithe young ape,
      A fine low-comedy bogy.

   And as they exercised their joints,
      Promoting quick digestion,
   They talked on several curious points,
      And raised this delicate question:
   âWhich of us two is Number Oneâ
      The ghostie, or the goblin?â
   And oâer the point they raised in fun
      They fairly fell a-squabblinâ.

   Theyâd barely speak, and each, in fine,
      Grew more and more reflective:
   Each thought his own particular line
      By chalks the more effective.
   At length they settled some one should
      By each of them be haunted,
   And so arrange that either could
      Exert his prowess vaunted.

   âThe Quaint against the Statuesqueââ
      By competition lawfulâ
   The goblin backed the Quaint Grotesque,
      The ghost the Grandly Awful.
   âNow,â said the goblin, âhereâs my planâ
      In attitude commanding,
   I see a stalwart Englishman
      By yonder tailorâs standing.

   âThe very fittest man on earth
      My influence to try onâ
   Of gentle, pârâaps of noble birth,
      And dauntless as a lion!
   Now wrap yourself within your shroudâ
      Remain in easy hearingâ
   Observeâyouâll hear him scream aloud
      When I begin appearing!â

   The imp with yell unearthlyâwildâ
      Threw off his dark enclosure:
   His dauntless victim looked and smiled
      With singular composure.
   For hours he tried to daunt the youth,
      For days, indeed, but vainlyâ
   The stripling smiled!âto tell the truth,
      The stripling smiled inanely.

   For weeks the goblin weird and wild,
      That noble stripling haunted;
   For weeks the stripling stood and smiled,
      Unmoved and all undaunted.
   The sombre ghost exclaimed, âYour plan
      Has failed you, goblin, plainly:
   Now watch yon hardy Hieland man,
      So stalwart and ungainly.

   âThese are the men who chase the roe,
      Whose footsteps never falter,
   Who bring with them, whereâer they go,
      A smack of old SIR WALTER.
   Of such as he, the men sublime
      Who lead their troops victorious,
   Whose deeds go down to after-time,
      Enshrined in annals glorious!

   âOf such as he the bard has said
      âHech thrawfuâ raltie rorkie!
   Wiâ thecht taâ croonie clapperhead
      And fashâ wiâ unco pawkie!â
   Heâll faint away when I appear,
      Upon his native heather;
   Or pârâaps heâll only scream with fear,
      Or pârâaps the two together.â

   The spectre showed himself, alone,
      To do his ghostly battling,
   With curdling groan and dismal moan,
      And lots of chains a-rattling!
   But noâthe chielâs stout Gaelic stuff
      Withstood all ghostly harrying;
   His fingers closed upon the snuff
      Which upwards he was carrying.

   For days that ghost declined to stir,
      A foggy shapeless giantâ
   For weeks that splendid officer
      Stared back again defiant.
   Just as the Englishman returned
      The goblinâs vulgar staring,
   Just so the Scotchman boldly spurned
      The ghostâs unmannered scaring.

   For several years the ghostly twain
      These Britons bold have haunted,
   But all their efforts are in vainâ
      Their victims stand undaunted.
   This very day the imp, and ghost,
      Whose powers the imp derided,
   Stand each at his allotted postâ
      The bet is undecided.




THE PHANTOM CURATE.
A FABLE.


   A BISHOP onceâI will not name his seeâ
      Annoyed his clergy in the mode conventional;
   From pulpit shackles never set them free,
      And found a sin where sin was unintentional.
            All pleasures ended in abuse auricularâ
            The Bishop was so terribly particular.

   Though, on the whole, a wise and upright man,
      He sought to make of human pleasures clearances;
   And form his priests on that much-lauded plan
      Which pays undue attention to appearances.
            He couldnât do good deeds without a psalm in âem,
            Although, in truth, he bore away the palm in âem.

   Enraged to find a deacon at a dance,
      Or catch a curate at some mild frivolity,
   He sought by open censure to enhance
      Their dread of joining harmless social jollity.
            Yet he enjoyed (a fact of notoriety)
            The ordinary pleasures of society.

   One evening, sitting at a pantomime
      (Forbidden treat to those who stood in fear of him),
   Roaring at jokes, _sans_ metre, sense, or rhyme,
      He turned, and saw immediately in rear of him,
            His peace of mind upsetting, and annoying it,
            A curate, also heartily enjoying it.

   Again, ât was Christmas Eve, and to enhance
      His childrenâs pleasure in their harmless rollicking,
   He, like a good old fellow, stood to dance;
      When something checked the current of his frolicking:
            That curate, with a maid he treated lover-ly,
            Stood up and figured with him in the âCoverley!â

   Once, yielding to an universal choice
      (The companyâs demand was an emphatic one,
   For the old Bishop had a glorious voice),
      In a quartet he joinedâan operatic one.
            Harmless enough, though neâer a word of grace in it,
            When, lo! that curate came and took the bass in it!

   One day, when passing through a quiet street,
      He stopped awhile and joined a Punchâs gathering;
   And chuckled more than solemn folk think meet,
      To see that gentleman his Judy lathering;
            And heard, as Punch was being treated penalty,
            That phantom curate laughing all hyÃ¦nally.

   Now at a picnic, âmid fair golden curls,
      Bright eyes, straw hats, _bottines_ that fit amazingly,
   A croquÃªt-bout is planned by all the girls;
      And he, consenting, speaks of croquÃªt praisingly;
            But suddenly declines to play at all in itâ
            The curate fiend has come to take a ball in it!

   Next, when at quiet sea-side village, freed
      From cares episcopal and ties monarchical,
   He grows his beard, and smokes his fragrant weed,
      In manner anything but hierarchicalâ
            He seesâand fixes an unearthly stare on itâ
            That curateâs face, with half a yard of hair on it!

   At length he gave a charge, and spake this word:
      âVicars, your curates to enjoyment urge ye may;
   To check their harmless pleasuringâs absurd;
      What laymen do without reproach, my clergy may.â
            He spake, and lo! at this concluding word of him,
            The curate vanishedâno one since has heard of him.




KING BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO.


   KING BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO
      Was a man-eating African swell;
   His sigh was a hullaballoo,
      His whisper a horrible yellâ
      A horrible, horrible yell!

   Four subjects, and all of them male,
      To BORRIA doubled the knee,
   They were once on a far larger scale,
      But heâd eaten the balance, you see
      (âScaleâ and âbalanceâ is punning, you see).

   There was haughty PISH-TUSH-POOH-BAH,
      There was lumbering DOODLE-DUM-DEY,
   Despairing ALACK-A-DEY-AH,
      And good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEHâ
      Exemplary TOOTLE-TUM-TEH.

   One day there was grief in the crew,
      For they hadnât a morsel of meat,
   And BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO
      Was dying for something to eatâ
      âCome, provide me with something to eat!

   âALACK-A-DEY, famished I feel;
      Oh, good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEH,
   Where on earth shall I look for a meal?
      For I havenât no dinner to-day!â
      Not a morsel of dinner to-day!

   âDear TOOTLE-TUM, what shall we do?
      Come, get us a meal, or, in truth,
   If you donât, we shall have to eat you,
      Oh, adorable friend of our youth!
      Thou beloved little friend of our youth!â

   And he answered, âOh, BUNGALEE BOO,
      For a moment I hope you will wait,â
   TIPPY-WIPPITY TOL-THE-ROL-LOO
      Is the Queen of a neighbouring stateâ
      A remarkably neighbouring state.

   âTIPPY-WIPPITY TOL-THE-ROL-LOO,
      She would pickle deliciously coldâ
   And her four pretty Amazons, too,
      Are enticing, and not very oldâ
      Twenty-seven is not very old.

   âThere is neat little TITTY-FOL-LEH,
      There is rollicking TRAL-THE-RAL-LAH,
   There is jocular WAGGETY-WEH,
      There is musical DOH-REH-MI-FAHâ
      Thereâs the nightingale DOH-REH-MI-FAH!â

   So the forces of BUNGALEE BOO
      Marched forth in a terrible row,
   And the ladies who fought for QUEEN LOO
      Prepared to encounter the foeâ
      This dreadful, insatiate foe!

   But they sharpened no weapons at all,
      And they poisoned no arrowsânot they!
   They made ready to conquer or fall
      In a totally different wayâ
      An entirely different way.

   With a crimson and pearly-white dye
      They endeavoured to make themselves fair,
   With black they encircled each eye,
      And with yellow they painted their hair
      (It was wool, but they thought it was hair).

   And the forces they met in the field:â
      And the men of KING BORRIA said,
   âAmazonians, immediately yield!â
      And their arrows they drew to the headâ
      Yes, drew them right up to the head.

   But jocular WAGGETY-WEH
      Ogled DOODLE-DUM-DEY (which was wrong),
   And neat little TITTY-FOL-LEH
      Said, âTOOTLE-TUM, you go along!
      You naughty old dear, go along!â

   And rollicking TRAL-THE-RAL-LAH
      Tapped ALACK-A-DEY-AH with her fan;
   And musical DOH-REH-MI-FAH
      Said, âPISH, go away, you bad man!
      Go away, you delightful young man!â

   And the Amazons simpered and sighed,
      And they ogled, and giggled, and flushed,
   And they opened their pretty eyes wide,
      And they chuckled, and flirted, and blushed
      (At least, if they could, theyâd have blushed).

   But haughty PISH-TUSH-POOH-BAH
      Said, âALACK-A-DEY, what does this mean?â
   And despairing ALACK-A-DEY-AH
      Said, âThey think us uncommonly green!
      Ha! ha! most uncommonly green!â

   Even blundering DOODLE-DUM-DEY
      Was insensible quite to their leers,
   And said good little TOOTLE-TUM-TEH,
      âItâs your blood we desire, pretty dearsâ
      We have come for our dinners, my dears!â

   And the Queen of the Amazons fell
      To BORRIA BUNGALEE BOO,â
   In a mouthful he gulped, with a yell,
      TIPPY-WIPPITY TOL-THE-ROL-LOOâ
      The pretty QUEEN TOL-THE-ROL-LOO.

   And neat little TITTY-FOL-LEH
      Was eaten by PISH-POOH-BAH,
   And light-hearted WAGGETY-WEH
      By dismal ALACK-A-DEY-AHâ
      Despairing ALACK-A-DEY-AH.

   And rollicking TRAL-THE-RAL-LAH
      Was eaten by DOODLE-DUM-DEY,
   And musical DOH-REH-MI-FAH
      By good little TOOTLE-DUM-TEHâ
      Exemplary TOOTLE-TUM-TEH!




BOB POLTER.


   BOB POLTER was a navvy, and
      His hands were coarse, and dirty too,
   His homely face was rough and tanned,
      His time of life was thirty-two.

   He lived among a working clan
      (A wife he hadnât got at all),
   A decent, steady, sober manâ
      No saint, howeverânot at all.

   He smoked, but in a modest way,
      Because he thought he needed it;
   He drank a pot of beer a day,
      And sometimes he exceeded it.

   At times heâd pass with other men
      A loud convivial night or two,
   With, very likely, now and then,
      On Saturdays, a fight or two.

   But still he was a sober soul,
      A labour-never-shirking man,
   Who paid his wayâupon the whole
      A decent English working man.

   One day, when at the Nelsonâs Head
      (For which he may be blamed of you),
   A holy man appeared, and said,
      âOh, ROBERT, Iâm ashamed of you.â

   He laid his hand on ROBERTâS beer
      Before he could drink up any,
   And on the floor, with sigh and tear,
      He poured the pot of âthruppenny.â

   âOh, ROBERT, at this very bar
      A truth youâll be discovering,
   A good and evil genius are
      Around your noddle hovering.

   âThey both are here to bid you shun
      The other oneâs society,
   For Total Abstinence is one,
      The other, Inebriety.â

   He waved his handâa vapour cameâ
      A wizard POLTER reckoned him;
   A bogy rose and called his name,
      And with his finger beckoned him.

   The monsterâs salient points to sum,â
      His heavy breath was portery:
   His glowing nose suggested rum:
      His eyes were gin-and-_wor_tery.

   His dress was tornâfor dregs of ale
      And slops of gin had rusted it;
   His pimpled face was wan and pale,
      Where filth had not encrusted it.

   âCome, POLTER,â said the fiend, âbegin,
      And keep the bowl a-flowing onâ
   A working man needs pints of gin
      To keep his clockwork going on.â

   BOB shuddered: âAh, youâve made a miss
      If you take me for one of you:
   You filthy beast, get out of thisâ
      BOB POLTER donât wanât none of you.â

   The demon gave a drunken shriek,
      And crept away in stealthiness,
   And lo! instead, a person sleek,
      Who seemed to burst with healthiness.

   âIn me, as your adviser hints,
      Of Abstinence youâve got a typeâ
   Of MR. TWEEDIEâS pretty prints
      I am the happy prototype.

   âIf you abjure the social toast,
      And pipes, and such frivolities,
   You possibly some day may boast
      My prepossessing qualities!â

   BOB rubbed his eyes, and made âem blink:
      âYou almost make me tremble, you!
   If I abjure fermented drink,
      Shall I, indeed, resemble you?

   âAnd will my whiskers curl so tight?
      My cheeks grow smug and muttony?
   My face become so red and white?
      My coat so blue and buttony?

   âWill trousers, such as yours, array
      Extremities inferior?
   Will chubbiness assert its sway
      All over my exterior?

   âIn this, my unenlightened state,
      To work in heavy boots I comes;
   Will pumps henceforward decorate
      My tiddle toddle tootsicums?

   âAnd shall I get so plump and fresh,
      And look no longer seedily?
   My skin will henceforth fit my flesh
      So tightly and so TWEEDIE-ly?â

   The phantom said, âYouâll have all this,
      Youâll know no kind of huffiness,
   Your life will be one chubby bliss,
      One long unruffled puffiness!â

   âBe off!â said irritated BOB.
      âWhy come you here to bother one?
   You pharisaical old snob,
      Youâre wuss almost than tâother one!

   âI takes my pipeâI takes my pot,
      And drunk Iâm never seen to be:
   Iâm no teetotaller or sot,
      And as I am I mean to be!â




THE STORY OF PRINCE AGIB.


   STRIKE the concertinaâs melancholy string!
   Blow the spirit-stirring harp like anything!
         Let the pianoâs martial blast
         Rouse the Echoes of the Past,
   For of AGIB, PRINCE OF TARTARY, I sing!

   Of AGIB, who, amid Tartaric scenes,
   Wrote a lot of ballet music in his teens:
         His gentle spirit rolls
         In the melody of soulsâ
   Which is pretty, but I donât know what it means.

   Of AGIB, who could readily, at sight,
   Strum a march upon the loud Theodolite.
         He would diligently play
         On the Zoetrope all day,
   And blow the gay Pantechnicon all night.

   One winterâI am shaky in my datesâ
   Came two starving Tartar minstrels to his gates;
         Oh, ALLAH be obeyed,
         How infernally they played!
   I remember that they called themselves the âOÃ¼aits.â

   Oh! that day of sorrow, misery, and rage,
   I shall carry to the Catacombs of Age,
         Photographically lined
         On the tablet of my mind,
   When a yesterday has faded from its page!

   Alas! PRINCE AGIB went and asked them in;
   Gave them beer, and eggs, and sweets, and scent, and tin.
         And when (as snobs would say)
         They had âput it all away,â
   He requested them to tune up and begin.

   Though its icy horror chill you to the core,
   I will tell you what I never told before,â
         The consequences true
         Of that awful interview,
   _For I listened at the keyhole in the door_!

   They played him a sonataâlet me see!
   â_Medulla oblongata_ââkey of G.
         Then they began to sing
         That extremely lovely thing,
   â_Scherzando_! _ma non troppo_, _ppp._â

   He gave them money, more than they could count,
   Scent from a most ingenious little fount,
         More beer, in little kegs,
         Many dozen hard-boiled eggs,
   And goodies to a fabulous amount.

   Now follows the dim horror of my tale,
   And I feel Iâm growing gradually pale,
         For, even at this day,
         Though its sting has passed away,
   When I venture to remember it, I quail!

   The elder of the brothers gave a squeal,
   All-overish it made me for to feel;
         âOh, PRINCE,â he says, says he,
         â_If a Prince indeed you be_,
   Iâve a mystery Iâm going to reveal!

   âOh, listen, if youâd shun a horrid death,
   To what the gent whoâs speaking to you saith:
         No âOÃ¼aitsâ in truth are we,
         As you fancy that we be,
   For (ter-remble!) I am ALECKâthis is BETH!â

   Said AGIB, âOh! accursed of your kind,
   I have heard that ye are men of evil mind!â
         BETH gave a dreadful shriekâ
         But before heâd time to speak
   I was mercilessly collared from behind.

   In number ten or twelve, or even more,
   They fastened me full length upon the floor.
         On my face extended flat,
         I was walloped with a cat
   For listening at the keyhole of a door.

   Oh! the horror of that agonizing thrill!
   (I can feel the place in frosty weather still).
         For a week from ten to four
         I was fastened to the floor,
   While a mercenary wopped me with a will

   They branded me and broke me on a wheel,
   And they left me in an hospital to heal;
         And, upon my solemn word,
         I have never never heard
   What those Tartars had determined to reveal.

   But that day of sorrow, misery, and rage,
   I shall carry to the Catacombs of Age,
         Photographically lined
         On the tablet of my mind,
   When a yesterday has faded from its page




ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.


   MACPHAIRSON CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS MCCLAN
   Was the son of an elderly labouring man;
   Youâve guessed him a Scotchman, shrewd reader, at sight,
   And pârâaps altogether, shrewd reader, youâre right.

   From the bonnie blue Forth to the lovely Deeside,
   Round by Dingwall and Wrath to the mouth of the Clyde,
   There wasnât a child or a woman or man
   Who could pipe with CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS MCCLAN.

   No other could wake such detestable groans,
   With reed and with chaunterâwith bag and with drones:
   All day and ill night he delighted the chiels
   With sniggering pibrochs and jiggety reels.

   Heâd clamber a mountain and squat on the ground,
   And the neighbouring maidens would gather around
   To list to the pipes and to gaze in his een,
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.

   All loved their MCCLAN, save a Sassenach brute,
   Who came to the Highlands to fish and to shoot;
   He dressed himself up in a Highlander way,
   Thoâ his name it was PATTISON CORBY TORBAY.

   TORBAY had incurred a good deal of expense
   To make him a Scotchman in every sense;
   But this is a matter, youâll readily own,
   That isnât a question of tailors alone.

   A Sassenach chief may be bonily built,
   He may purchase a sporran, a bonnet, and kilt;
   Stick a skeÃ¤n in his hoseâwear an acre of stripesâ
   But he cannot assume an affection for pipes.

   CLONGLOCKETYâS pipings all night and all day
   Quite frenzied poor PATTISON CORBY TORBAY;
   The girls were amused at his singular spleen,
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN,

   âMACPHAIRSON CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS, my lad,
   With pibrochs and reels you are driving me mad.
   If you really must play on that cursed affair,
   My goodness! play something resembling an air.â

   Boiled over the blood of MACPHAIRSON MCCLANâ
   The Clan of Clonglocketty rose as one man;
   For all were enraged at the insult, I weenâ
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.

   âLetâs show,â said MCCLAN, âto this Sassenach loon
   That the bagpipes _can_ play him a regular tune.
   Letâs see,â said MCCLAN, as he thoughtfully sat,
   ââ_In my Cottage_â is easyâIâll practise at that.â

   He blew at his âCottage,â and blew with a will,
   For a year, seven months, and a fortnight, until
   (Youâll hardly believe it) MCCLAN, I declare,
   Elicited something resembling an air.

   It was wildâit was fitfulâas wild as the breezeâ
   It wandered about into several keys;
   It was jerky, spasmodic, and harsh, Iâm aware;
   But still it distinctly suggested an air.

   The Sassenach screamed, and the Sassenach danced;
   He shrieked in his agonyâbellowed and pranced;
   And the maidens who gathered rejoiced at the sceneâ
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.

   âHech gather, hech gather, hech gather around;
   And fill aâ ye lugs wiâ the exquisite sound.
   An air fraâ the bagpipesâbeat that if ye can!
   Hurrah for CLONGLOCKETTY ANGUS MCCLAN!â

   The fame of his piping spread over the land:
   Respectable widows proposed for his hand,
   And maidens came flocking to sit on the greenâ
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.

   One morning the fidgety Sassenach swore
   Heâd stand it no longerâhe drew his claymore,
   And (this was, I think, in extremely bad taste)
   Divided CLONGLOCKETTY close to the waist.

   Oh! loud were the wailings for ANGUS MCCLAN,
   Oh! deep was the grief for that excellent man;
   The maids stood aghast at the horrible sceneâ
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.

   It sorrowed poor PATTISON CORBY TORBAY
   To find them âtake onâ in this serious way;
   He pitied the poor little fluttering birds,
   And solaced their souls with the following words:

   âOh, maidens,â said PATTISON, touching his hat,
   âDonât blubber, my dears, for a fellow like that;
   Observe, Iâm a very superior man,
   A much better fellow than ANGUS MCCLAN.â

   They smiled when he winked and addressed them as âdears,â
   And they all of them vowed, as they dried up their tears,
   A pleasanter gentleman never was seenâ
   Especially ELLEN MCJONES ABERDEEN.




PETER THE WAG.


   POLICEMAN PETER FORTH I drag
      From his obscure retreat:
   He was a merry genial wag,
      Who loved a mad conceit.
   If he were asked the time of day,
      By country bumpkins green,
   He not unfrequently would say,
      âA quarter past thirteen.â

   If ever you by word of mouth
      Inquired of MISTER FORTH
   The way to somewhere in the South,
      He always sent you North.
   With little boys his beat along
      He loved to stop and play;
   He loved to send old ladies wrong,
      And teach their feet to stray.

   He would in frolic moments, when
      Such mischief bent upon,
   Take Bishops up as betting menâ
      Bid Ministers move on.
   Then all the worthy boys he knew
      He regularly licked,
   And always collared people who
      Had had their pockets picked.

   He was not naturally bad,
      Or viciously inclined,
   But from his early youth he had
      A waggish turn of mind.
   The Men of London grimly scowled
      With indignation wild;
   The Men of London gruffly growled,
      But PETER calmly smiled.

   Against this minion of the Crown
      The swelling murmurs grewâ
   From Camberwell to Kentish Townâ
      From Rotherhithe to Kew.
   Still humoured he his wagsome turn,
      And fed in various ways
   The coward rage that dared to burn,
      But did not dare to blaze.

   Still, Retribution has her day,
      Although her flight is slow:
   _One day that Crusher lost his way_
      _Near Poland Street_, _Soho_.
   The haughty boy, too proud to ask,
      To find his way resolved,
   And in the tangle of his task
      Got more and more involved.

   The Men of London, overjoyed,
      Came there to jeer their foe,
   And flocking crowds completely cloyed
      The mazes of Soho.
   The news on telegraphic wires
      Sped swiftly oâer the lea,
   Excursion trains from distant shires
      Brought myriads to see.

   For weeks he trod his self-made beats
      Through Newport- Gerrard- Bear-
   Greek- Rupert- Frith- Dean- Poland- Streets,
      And into Golden Square.
   But all, alas! in vain, for when
      He tried to learn the way
   Of little boys or grown-up men,
      They none of them would say.

   Their eyes would flashâtheir teeth would grindâ
      Their lips would tightly curlâ
   Theyâd say, âThy way thyself must find,
      Thou misdirecting churl!â
   And, similarly, also, when
      He tried a foreign friend;
   Italians answered, â_Il balen_ââ
      The French, âNo comprehend.â

   The Russ would say with gleaming eye
      âSevastopol!â and groan.
   The Greek said, âÎ¤ÏÏÏÏ, ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Î¼Î±Î¹,
      Î¤ÏÏÏÏ, ÏÏÏÏÎµÎ¹Î½, ÏÏÏÏÏÎ½.â
   To wander thus for many a year
      That Crusher never ceasedâ
   The Men of London dropped a tear,
      Their anger was appeased.

   At length exploring gangs were sent
      To find poor FORTHâS remainsâ
   A handsome grant by Parliament
      Was voted for their pains.
   To seek the poor policeman out
      Bold spirits volunteered,
   And when they swore theyâd solve the doubt,
      The Men of London cheered.

   And in a yard, dark, dank, and drear,
      They found him, on the floorâ
   It leads from Richmond Buildingsânear
      The Royalty stage-door.
   With brandy cold and brandy hot
      They plied him, starved and wet,
   And made him sergeant on the spotâ
      The Men of Londonâs pet!

GENTLE ALICE BROWN.


   IT was a robberâs daughter, and her name was ALICE BROWN,
   Her father was the terror of a small Italian town;
   Her mother was a foolish, weak, but amiable old thing;
   But it isnât of her parents that Iâm going for to sing.

   As ALICE was a-sitting at her window-sill one day,
   A beautiful young gentleman he chanced to pass that way;
   She cast her eyes upon him, and he looked so good and true,
   That she thought, âI could be happy with a gentleman like you!â

   And every morning passed her house that cream of gentlemen,
   She knew she might expect him at a quarter unto ten;
   A sorter in the Custom-house, it was his daily road
   (The Custom-house was fifteen minutesâ walk from her abode).

   But ALICE was a pious girl, who knew it wasnât wise
   To look at strange young sorters with expressive purple eyes;
   So she sought the village priest to whom her family confessed,
   The priest by whom their little sins were carefully assessed.

   âOh, holy father,â ALICE said, âât would grieve you, would it not,
   To discover that I was a most disreputable lot?
   Of all unhappy sinners Iâm the most unhappy one!â
   The padre said, âWhatever have you been and gone and done?â

   âI have helped mamma to steal a little kiddy from its dad,
   Iâve assisted dear papa in cutting up a little lad,
   Iâve planned a little burglary and forged a little cheque,
   And slain a little baby for the coral on its neck!â

   The worthy pastor heaved a sigh, and dropped a silent tear,
   And said, âYou mustnât judge yourself too heavily, my dear:
   Itâs wrong to murder babies, little corals for to fleece;
   But sins like these one expiates at half-a-crown apiece.

   âGirls will be girlsâyouâre very young, and flighty in your mind;
   Old heads upon young shoulders we must not expect to find:
   We mustnât be too hard upon these little girlish tricksâ
   Letâs seeâfive crimes at half-a-crownâexactly twelve-and-six.â

   âOh, father,â little Alice cried, âyour kindness makes me weep,
   You do these little things for me so singularly cheapâ
   Your thoughtful liberality I never can forget;
   But, oh! there is another crime I havenât mentioned yet!

   âA pleasant-looking gentleman, with pretty purple eyes,
   Iâve noticed at my window, as Iâve sat a-catching flies;
   He passes by it every day as certain as can beâ
   I blush to say Iâve winked at him, and he has winked at me!â

   âFor shame!â said FATHER PAUL, âmy erring daughter!  On my word
   This is the most distressing news that I have ever heard.
   Why, naughty girl, your excellent papa has pledged your hand
   To a promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band!

   âThis dreadful piece of news will pain your worthy parents so!
   They are the most remunerative customers I know;
   For many many years theyâve kept starvation from my doors:
   I never knew so criminal a family as yours!

   âThe common country folk in this insipid neighbourhood
   Have nothing to confess, theyâre so ridiculously good;
   And if you marry any one respectable at all,
   Why, youâll reform, and what will then become of FATHER PAUL?â

   The worthy priest, he up and drew his cowl upon his crown,
   And started off in haste to tell the news to ROBBER BROWNâ
   To tell him how his daughter, who was now for marriage fit,
   Had winked upon a sorter, who reciprocated it.

   Good ROBBER BROWN he muffled up his anger pretty well:
   He said, âI have a notion, and that notion I will tell;
   I will nab this gay young sorter, terrify him into fits,
   And get my gentle wife to chop him into little bits.

   âIâve studied human nature, and I know a thing or two:
   Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many doâ
   A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall
   When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small.â

   He traced that gallant sorter to a still suburban square;
   He watched his opportunity, and seized him unaware;
   He took a life-preserver and he hit him on the head,
   And MRS. BROWN dissected him before she went to bed.

   And pretty little ALICE grew more settled in her mind,
   She never more was guilty of a weakness of the kind,
   Until at length good ROBBER BROWN bestowed her pretty hand
   On the promising young robber, the lieutenant of his band.




MISTER WILLIAM.


   OH, listen to the tale of MISTER WILLIAM, if you please,
   Whom naughty, naughty judges sent away beyond the seas.
   He forged a partyâs will, which caused anxiety and strife,
   Resulting in his getting penal servitude for life.

   He was a kindly goodly man, and naturally prone,
   Instead of taking othersâ gold, to give away his own.
   But he had heard of Vice, and longed for only once to strikeâ
   To plan _one_ little wickednessâto see what it was like.

   He argued with himself, and said, âA spotless man am I;
   I canât be more respectable, however hard I try!
   For six and thirty years Iâve always been as good as gold,
   And now for half an hour Iâll plan infamy untold!

   âA baby who is wicked at the early age of one,
   And then reformsâand dies at thirty-six a spotless son,
   Is never, never saddled with his babyhoodâs defect,
   But earns from worthy men consideration and respect.

   âSo one who never revelled in discreditable tricks
   Until he reached the comfortable age of thirty-six,
   May then for half an hour perpetrate a deed of shame,
   Without incurring permanent disgrace, or even blame.

   âThat babies donât commit such crimes as forgery is true,
   But little sins develop, if you leave âem to accrue;
   And he who shuns all vices as successive seasons roll,
   Should reap at length the benefit of so much self-control.

   âThe common sin of babyhoodâobjecting to be drestâ
   If you leave it to accumulate at compound interest,
   For anything you know, may represent, if youâre alive,
   A burglary or murder at the age of thirty-five.

   âStill, I wouldnât take advantage of this fact, but be content
   With some pardonable follyâitâs a mere experiment.
   The greater the temptation to go wrong, the less the sin;
   So with something thatâs particularly tempting Iâll begin.

   âI would not steal a penny, for my incomeâs very fairâ
   I do not want a pennyâI have pennies and to spareâ
   And if I stole a penny from a money-bag or till,
   The sin would be enormousâthe temptation being _nil_.

   âBut if I broke asunder all such pettifogging bounds,
   And forged a partyâs Will for (say) Five Hundred Thousand Pounds,
   With such an irresistible temptation to a haul,
   Of course the sin must be infinitesimally small.

   âThereâs WILSON who is dyingâhe has wealth from Stock and rentâ
   If I divert his riches from their natural descent,
   Iâm placed in a position to indulge each little whim.â
   So he diverted themâand they, in turn, diverted him.

   Unfortunately, though, by some unpardonable flaw,
   Temptation isnât recognized by Britainâs Common Law;
   Men found him out by some peculiarity of touch,
   And WILLIAM got a âlifer,â which annoyed him very much.

   For, ah! he never reconciled himself to life in gaol,
   He fretted and he pined, and grew dispirited and pale;
   He was numbered like a cabman, too, which told upon him so
   That his spirits, once so buoyant, grew uncomfortably low.

   And sympathetic gaolers would remark, âItâs very true,
   He ainât been brought up common, like the likes of me and you.â
   So they took him into hospital, and gave him mutton chops,
   And chocolate, and arrowroot, and buns, and malt and hops.

   Kind Clergymen, besides, grew interested in his fate,
   Affected by the details of his pitiable state.
   They waited on the Secretary, somewhere in Whitehall,
   Who said he would receive them any day they liked to call.

   âConsider, sir, the hardship of this interesting case:
   A prison life brings with it something very like disgrace;
   Itâs telling on young WILLIAM, whoâs reduced to skin and boneâ
   Remember heâs a gentleman, with money of his own.

   âHe had an ample income, and of course he stands in need
   Of sherry with his dinner, and his customary weed;
   No delicacies now can pass his gentlemanly lipsâ
   He misses his sea-bathing and his continental trips.

   âHe says the other prisoners are commonplace and rude;
   He says he cannot relish uncongenial prison food.
   When quite a boy they taught him to distinguish Good from Bad,
   And other educational advantages heâs had.

   âA burglar or garotter, or, indeed, a common thief
   Is very glad to batten on potatoes and on beef,
   Or anything, in short, that prison kitchens can afford,â
   A cut above the diet in a common workhouse ward.

   âBut beef and mutton-broth donât seem to suit our WILLIAMâS whim,
   A boon to other prisonersâa punishment to him.
   It never was intended that the discipline of gaol
   Should dash a convictâs spirits, sir, or make him thin or pale.â

   âGood Gracious Me!â that sympathetic Secretary cried,
   âSuppose in prison fetters MISTER WILLIAM should have died!
   Dear me, of course!  Imprisonment for _Life_ his sentence saith:
   Iâm very glad you mentioned itâit might have been For Death!

   âRelease him with a ticketâheâll be better then, no doubt,
   And tell him I apologize.â  So MISTER WILLIAMâS out.
   I hope he will be careful in his manuscripts, Iâm sure,
   And not begin experimentalizing any more.




THE BUMBOAT WOMANâS STORY.


   IâM old, my dears, and shrivelled with age, and work, and grief,
   My eyes are gone, and my teeth have been drawn by Time, the Thief!
   For terrible sights Iâve seen, and dangers great Iâve runâ
   Iâm nearly seventy now, and my work is almost done!

   Ah!  Iâve been young in my time, and Iâve played the deuce with men!
   Iâm speaking of ten years pastâI was barely sixty then:
   My cheeks were mellow and soft, and my eyes were large and sweet,
   POLL PINEAPPLEâS eyes were the standing toast of the Royal Fleet!

   A bumboat woman was I, and I faithfully served the ships
   With apples and cakes, and fowls, and beer, and halfpenny dips,
   And beef for the generous mess, where the officers dine at nights,
   And fine fresh peppermint drops for the rollicking midshipmites.

   Of all the kind commanders who anchored in Portsmouth Bay,
   By far the sweetest of all was kind LIEUTENANT BELAYE.â
   LIEUTENANT BELAYE commanded the gunboat _Hot Cross Bun_,
   She was seven and thirty feet in length, and she carried a gun.

   With a laudable view of enhancing his countryâs naval pride,
   When people inquired her size, LIEUTENANT BELAYE replied,
   âOh, my ship, my ship is the first of the Hundred and Seventy-ones!â
   Which meant her tonnage, but people imagined it meant her guns.

   Whenever I went on board he would beckon me down below,
   âCome down, Little Buttercup, comeâ (for he loved to call me so),
   And heâd tell of the fights at sea in which heâd taken a part,
   And so LIEUTENANT BELAYE won poor POLL PINEAPPLEâS heart!

   But at length his orders came, and he said one day, said he,
   âIâm ordered to sail with the _Hot Cross Bun_ to the German Sea.â
   And the Portsmouth maidens wept when they learnt the evil day,
   For every Portsmouth maid loved good LIEUTENANT BELAYE.

   And I went to a back back street, with plenty of cheap cheap shops,
   And I bought an oilskin hat and a second-hand suit of slops,
   And I went to LIEUTENANT BELAYE (and he never suspected _me_!)
   And I entered myself as a chap as wanted to go to sea.

   We sailed that afternoon at the mystic hour of one,â
   Remarkably nice young men were the crew of the _Hot Cross Bun_,
   Iâm sorry to say that Iâve heard that sailors sometimes swear,
   But I never yet heard a _Bun_ say anything wrong, I declare.

   When Jack Tars meet, they meet with a âMessmate, ho!  What cheer?â
   But here, on the _Hot Cross Bun_, it was âHow do you do, my dear?â
   When Jack Tars growl, I believe they growl with a big big Dâ
   But the strongest oath of the _Hot Cross Buns_ was a mild âDear me!â

   Yet, though they were all well-bred, you could scarcely call them
   slick:
   Whenever a sea was on, they were all extremely sick;
   And whenever the weather was calm, and the wind was light and fair,
   They spent more time than a sailor should on his back back hair.

   They certainly shivered and shook when ordered aloft to run,
   And they screamed when LIEUTENANT BELAYE discharged his only gun.
   And as he was proud of his gunâsuch pride is hardly wrongâ
   The Lieutenant was blazing away at intervals all day long.

   They all agreed very well, though at times you heard it said
   That BILL had a way of his own of making his lips look redâ
   That JOE looked quite his ageâor somebody might declare
   That BARNACLEâS long pig-tail was never his own own hair.

   BELAYE would admit that his men were of no great use to him,
   âBut, then,â he would say, âthere is little to do on a gunboat trim
   I can hand, and reef, and steer, and fire my big gun tooâ
   And it _is_ such a treat to sail with a gentle well-bred crew.â

   I saw him every day.  How the happy moments sped!
   Reef topsails!  Make all taut!  Thereâs dirty weather ahead!
   (I do not mean that tempests threatened the _Hot Cross Bun_:
   In _that_ case, I donât know whatever we _should_ have done!)

   After a fortnightâs cruise, we put into port one day,
   And off on leave for a week went kind LIEUTENANT BELAYE,
   And after a long long week had passed (and it seemed like a life),
   LIEUTENANT BELAYE returned to his ship with a fair young wife!

   He up, and he says, says he, âO crew of the _Hot Cross Bun_,
   Here is the wife of my heart, for the Church has made us one!â
   And as he uttered the word, the crew went out of their wits,
   And all fell down in so many separate fainting-fits.

   And then their hair came down, or off, as the case might be,
   And lo! the rest of the crew were simple girls, like me,
   Who all had fled from their homes in a sailorâs blue array,
   To follow the shifting fate of kind LIEUTENANT BELAYE.

                             * * * * * * * *

   Itâs strange to think that _I_ should ever have loved young men,
   But Iâm speaking of ten years pastâI was barely sixty then,
   And now my cheeks are furrowed with grief and age, I trow!
   And poor POLL PINEAPPLEâS eyes have lost their lustre now!




LOST MR. BLAKE.


   MR. BLAKE was a regular out-and-out hardened sinner,
      Who was quite out of the pale of Christianity, so to speak,
   He was in the habit of smoking a long pipe and drinking a glass of
   grog on a Sunday after dinner,
      And seldom thought of going to church more than twice orâif Good
   Friday or Christmas Day happened to come in itâthree times a week.

   He was quite indifferent as to the particular kinds of dresses
      That the clergyman wore at church where he used to go to pray,
   And whatever he did in the way of relieving a chapâs distresses,
      He always did in a nasty, sneaking, underhanded, hole-and-corner
   sort of way.

   I have known him indulge in profane, ungentlemanly emphatics,
      When the Protestant Church has been divided on the subject of the
   proper width of a chasubleâs hem;
   I have even known him to sneer at albsâand as for dalmatics,
      Words canât convey an idea of the contempt he expressed for _them_.

   He didnât believe in persons who, not being well off themselves, are
   obliged to confine their charitable exertions to collecting money from
   wealthier people,
      And looked upon individuals of the former class as ecclesiastical
   hawks;
   He used to say that he would no more think of interfering with his
   priestâs robes than with his church or his steeple,
      And that he did not consider his soul imperilled because somebody
   over whom he had no influence whatever, chose to dress himself up like
   an exaggerated GUY FAWKES.

   This shocking old vagabond was so unutterably shameless
      That he actually went a-courting a very respectable and pious
   middle-aged sister, by the name of BIGGS.
   She was a rather attractive widow, whose life as such had always been
   particularly blameless;
      Her first husband had left her a secure but moderate competence,
   owing to some fortunate speculations in the matter of figs.

   She was an excellent person in every wayâand won the respect even of
   MRS. GRUNDY,
      She was a good housewife, too, and wouldnât have wasted a penny if
   she had owned the Koh-i-noor.
   She was just as strict as he was lax in her observance of Sunday,
      And being a good economist, and charitable besides, she took all
   the bones and cold potatoes and broken pie-crusts and candle-ends
   (when she had quite done with them), and made them into an excellent
   soup for the deserving poor.

   I am sorry to say that she rather took to BLAKEâthat outcast of
   society,
      And when respectable brothers who were fond of her began to look
   dubious and to cough,
   She would say, âOh, my friends, itâs because I hope to bring this poor
   benighted soul back to virtue and propriety,â
      And besides, the poor benighted soul, with all his faults, was
   uncommonly well off.

   And when MR. BLAKEâS dissipated friends called his attention to the
   frown or the pout of her,
      Whenever he did anything which appeared to her to savour of an
   unmentionable place,
   He would say that âshe would be a very decent old girl when all that
   nonsense was knocked out of her,â
      And his method of knocking it out of her is one that covered him
   with disgrace.

   She was fond of going to church services four times every Sunday, and,
   four or five times in the week, and never seemed to pall of them,
      So he hunted out all the churches within a convenient distance that
   had services at different hours, so to speak;
   And when he had married her he positively insisted upon their going to
   all of them,
      So they contrived to do about twelve churches every Sunday, and, if
   they had luck, from twenty-two to twenty-three in the course of the
   week.

   She was fond of dropping his sovereigns ostentatiously into the plate,
   and she liked to see them stand out rather conspicuously against the
   commonplace half-crowns and shillings,
      So he took her to all the charity sermons, and if by any
   extraordinary chance there wasnât a charity sermon anywhere, he would
   drop a couple of sovereigns (one for him and one for her) into the
   poor-box at the door;
   And as he always deducted the sums thus given in charity from the
   housekeeping money, and the money he allowed her for her bonnets and
   frillings,
      She soon began to find that even charity, if you allow it to
   interfere with your personal luxuries, becomes an intolerable bore.

   On Sundays she was always melancholy and anything but good society,
      For that day in her household was a day of sighings and sobbings
   and wringing of hands and shaking of heads:
   She wouldnât hear of a button being sewn on a glove, because it was a
   work neither of necessity nor of piety,
      And strictly prohibited her servants from amusing themselves, or
   indeed doing anything at all except dusting the drawing-rooms,
   cleaning the boots and shoes, cooking the parlour dinner, waiting
   generally on the family, and making the beds.

   But BLAKE even went further than that, and said that people should do
   their own works of necessity, and not delegate them to persons in a
   menial situation,
      So he wouldnât allow his servants to do so much as even answer a
   bell.
   Here he is making his wife carry up the water for her bath to the
   second floor, much against her inclination,â
      And why in the world the gentleman who illustrates these ballads
   has put him in a cocked hat is more than I can tell.

   After about three months of this sort of thing, taking the smooth with
   the rough of it,
      (Blacking her own boots and peeling her own potatoes was not her
   notion of connubial bliss),
   MRS. BLAKE began to find that she had pretty nearly had enough of it,
      And came, in course of time, to think that BLAKEâS own original
   line of conduct wasnât so much amiss.

   And now that wicked personâthat detestable sinner (âBELIAL BLAKEâ his
   friends and well-wishers call him for his atrocities),
      And his poor deluded victim, whom all her Christian brothers
   dislike and pity so,
   Go to the parish church only on Sunday morning and afternoon and
   occasionally on a week-day, and spend their evenings in connubial
   fondlings and affectionate reciprocities,
      And I should like to know where in the world (or rather, out of it)
   they expect to go!




THE BABYâS VENGEANCE.


   WEARY at heart and extremely ill
   Was PALEY VOLLAIRE of Bromptonville,
   In a dirty lodging, with fever down,
   Close to the Polygon, Somers Town.

   PALEY VOLLAIRE was an only son
   (For why?  His mother had had but one),
   And PALEY inherited gold and grounds
   Worth several hundred thousand pounds.

   But he, like many a rich young man,
   Through this magnificent fortune ran,
   And nothing was left for his daily needs
   But duplicate copies of mortgage-deeds.

   Shabby and sorry and sorely sick,
   He slept, and dreamt that the clockâs âtick, tick,â
   Was one of the Fates, with a long sharp knife,
   Snicking off bits of his shortened life.

   He woke and counted the pips on the walls,
   The outdoor passengersâ loud footfalls,
   And reckoned all over, and reckoned again,
   The little white tufts on his counterpane.

   A medical man to his bedside came.
   (I canât remember that doctorâs name),
   And said, âYouâll die in a very short while
   If you donât set sail for Madeiraâs isle.â

   âGo to Madeira? goodness me!
   I havenât the money to pay your fee!â
   âThen, PALEY VOLLAIRE,â said the leech, âgood bye;
   Iâll come no more, for yourâre sure to die.â

   He sighed and he groaned and smote his breast;
   âOh, send,â said he, âfor FREDERICK WEST,
   Ere senses fade or my eyes grow dim:
   Iâve a terrible tale to whisper him!â

   Poor was FREDERICKâS lot in life,â
   A dustman he with a fair young wife,
   A worthy man with a hard-earned store,
   A hundred and seventy poundsâor more.

   FREDERICK came, and he said, âMaybe
   Youâll say what you happened to want with me?â
   âWronged boy,â said PALEY VOLLAIRE, âI will,
   But donât you fidget yourselfâsit still.â

                            THE TERRIBLE TALE.

   ââTis now some thirty-seven years ago
   Since first began the plot that Iâm revealing,
   A fine young woman, whom you ought to know,
      Lived with her husband down in Drum Lane, Ealing.
   Herself by means of mangling reimbursing,
   And now and then (at intervals) wet-nursing.

   âTwo little babes dwelt in their humble cot:
   One was her ownâthe other only lent to her:
   _Her own she slighted_.  Tempted by a lot
      Of gold and silver regularly sent to her,
   She ministered unto the little other
   In the capacity of foster-mother.

   â_I was her own_.  Oh! how I lay and sobbed
   In my poor cradleâdeeply, deeply cursing
   The rich manâs pampered bantling, who had robbed
      My only birthrightâan attentive nursing!
   Sometimes in hatred of my foster-brother,
   I gnashed my gumsâwhich terrified my mother.

   âOne dayâit was quite early in the weekâ
   I _in_ MY _cradle having placed the bantling_â
   Crept into his!  He had not learnt to speak,
      But I could see his face with anger mantling.
   It was imprudentâwell, disgraceful maybe,
   For, oh!  I was a bad, blackhearted baby!

   âSo great a luxury was food, I think
   No wickedness but I was game to try for it.
   _Now_ if I wanted anything to drink
      At any time, I only had to cry for it!
   _Once_, if I dared to weep, the bottle lacking,
   My blubbering involved a serious smacking!

   âWe grew up in the usual wayâmy friend,
   My foster-brother, daily growing thinner,
   While gradually I began to mend,
      And thrived amazingly on double dinner.
   And every one, besides my foster-mother,
   Believed that either of us was the other.

   âI came into _his_ wealthâI bore _his_ name,
   I bear it stillâ_his_ property I squanderedâ
   I mortgaged everythingâand now (oh, shame!)
      Into a Somers Town shake-down Iâve wandered!
   I am no PALEYâno, VOLLAIREâitâs true, my boy!
   The only rightful PALEY V. is _you_, my boy!

   âAnd all I have is yoursâand yours is mine.
   I still may place you in your true position:
   Give me the pounds youâve saved, and Iâll resign
      My noble name, my rank, and my condition.
   So far my wickedness in falsely owning
   Your vasty wealth, I am at last atoning!â

                              * * * * * * *

   FREDERICK he was a simple soul,
   He pulled from his pocket a bulky roll,
   And gave to PALEY his hard-earned store,
   A hundred and seventy pounds or more.

   PALEY VOLLAIRE, with many a groan,
   Gave FREDERICK all that he called his own,â
   Two shirts and a sock, and a vest of jean,
   A Wellington boot and a bamboo cane.

   And FRED (entitled to all things there)
   He took the fever from MR. VOLLAIRE,
   Which killed poor FREDERICK WEST.  Meanwhile
   VOLLAIRE sailed off to Madeiraâs isle.




THE CAPTAIN AND THE MERMAIDS.


   I SING a legend of the sea,
   So hard-a-port upon your lee!
      A ship on starboard tack!
   Sheâs bound upon a private cruiseâ
   (This is the kind of spice I use
      To give a salt-sea smack).

   Behold, on every afternoon
   (Save in a gale or strong Monsoon)
      Great CAPTAIN CAPEL CLEGGS
   (Great morally, though rather short)
   Sat at an open weather-port
      And aired his shapely legs.

   And Mermaids hung around in flocks,
   On cable chains and distant rocks,
      To gaze upon those limbs;
   For legs like those, of flesh and bone,
   Are things ânot generally knownâ
      To any Merman TIMBS.

   But Mermen didnât seem to care
   Much time (as far as Iâm aware)
      With CLEGGSâS legs to spend;
   Though Mermaids swam around all day
   And gazed, exclaiming, â_Thatâs_ the way
      A gentleman should end!

   âA pair of legs with well-cut knees,
   And calves and ankles such as these
      Which we in rapture hail,
   Are far more eloquent, itâs clear
   (When clothed in silk and kerseymere),
      Than any nasty tail.â

   And CLEGGSâa worthy kind old boyâ
   Rejoiced to add to othersâ joy,
      And, when the day was dry,
   Because it pleased the lookers-on,
   He sat from morn till nightâthough con-
      Stitutionally shy.

   At first the Mermen laughed, âPooh! pooh!â
   But finally they jealous grew,
      And sounded loud recalls;
   But vainly.  So these fishy males
   Declared they too would clothe their tails
      In silken hose and smalls.

   They set to work, these water-men,
   And made their nether robesâbut when
      They drew with dainty touch
   The kerseymere upon their tails,
   They found it scraped against their scales,
      And hurt them very much.

   The silk, besides, with which they chose
   To deck their tails by way of hose
      (They never thought of shoon),
   For such a use was much too thin,â
   It tore against the caudal fin,
      And âwent in laddersâ soon.

   So they designed another plan:
   They sent their most seductive man
      This note to him to showâ
   âOur Monarch sends to CAPTAIN CLEGGS
   His humble compliments, and begs
      Heâll join him down below;

   âWeâve pleasant homes below the seaâ
   Besides, if CAPTAIN CLEGGS should be
      (As our advices say)
   A judge of Mermaids, he will find
   Our lady-fish of every kind
      Inspection will repay.â

   Good CAPEL sent a kind reply,
   For CAPEL thought he could descry
      An admirable plan
   To study all their ways and lawsâ
   (But not their lady-fish, because
      He was a married man).

   The Merman sankâthe Captain too
   Jumped overboard, and dropped from view
      Like stone from catapult;
   And when he reached the Mermanâs lair,
   He certainly was welcomed there,
      But, ah! with what result?

   They didnât let him learn their law,
   Or make a note of what he saw,
      Or interesting mem.:
   The lady-fish he couldnât find,
   But that, of course, he didnât mindâ
      He didnât come for them.

   For though, when CAPTAIN CAPEL sank,
   The Mermen drawn in double rank
      Gave him a hearty hail,
   Yet when secure of CAPTAIN CLEGGS,
   They cut off both his lovely legs,
      And gave him _such_ a tail!

   When CAPTAIN CLEGGS returned aboard,
   His blithesome crew convulsive roarâd,
      To see him altered so.
   The Admiralty did insist
   That he upon the Half-pay List
      Immediately should go.

   In vain declared the poor old salt,
   âItâs my misfortuneânot my fault,â
      With tear and trembling lipâ
   In vain poor CAPEL begged and begged.
   âA man must be completely legged
      Who rules a British ship.â

   So spake the stern First Lord aloudâ
   He was a wag, though very proud,
      And much rejoiced to say,
   âYouâre only half a captain nowâ
   And so, my worthy friend, I vow
      Youâll only get half-pay!â




ANNIE PROTHEROE.
A LEGEND OF STRATFORD-LE-BOW.


   OH! listen to the tale of little ANNIE PROTHEROE.
   She kept a small post-office in the neighbourhood of Bow;
   She loved a skilled mechanic, who was famous in his dayâ
   A gentle executioner whose name was GILBERT CLAY.

   I think I hear you say, âA dreadful subject for your rhymes!â
   O reader, do not shrinkâhe didnât live in modern times!
   He lived so long ago (the sketch will show it at a glance)
   That all his actions glitter with the lime-light of Romance.

   In busy times he laboured at his gentle craft all dayâ
   âNo doubt you mean his Cal-craft,â you amusingly will sayâ
   But, noâhe didnât operate with common bits of string,
   He was a Public Headsman, which is quite another thing.

   And when his work was over, they would ramble oâer the lea,
   And sit beneath the frondage of an elderberry tree,
   And ANNIEâS simple prattle entertained him on his walk,
   For public executions formed the subject of her talk.

   And sometimes heâd explain to her, which charmed her very much,
   How famous operators vary very much in touch,
   And then, perhaps, heâd show how he himself performed the trick,
   And illustrate his meaning with a poppy and a stick.

   Or, if it rained, the little maid would stop at home, and look
   At his favourable notices, all pasted in a book,
   And then her cheek would flushâher swimming eyes would dance with joy
   In a glow of admiration at the prowess of her boy.

   One summer eve, at supper-time, the gentle GILBERT said
   (As he helped his pretty ANNIE to a slice of collared head),
   âThis reminds me I must settle on the next ensuing day
   The hash of that unmitigated villain PETER GRAY.â

   He saw his ANNIE tremble and he saw his ANNIE start,
   Her changing colour trumpeted the flutter at her heart;
   Young GILBERTâS manly bosom rose and sank with jealous fear,
   And he said, âO gentle ANNIE, whatâs the meaning of this here?â

   And ANNIE answered, blushing in an interesting way,
   âYou think, no doubt, Iâm sighing for that felon PETER GRAY:
   That I was his young woman is unquestionably true,
   But not since I began a-keeping company with you.â

   Then GILBERT, who was irritable, rose and loudly swore
   Heâd know the reason why if she refused to tell him more;
   And she answered (all the woman in her flashing from her eyes)
   âYou mustnât ask no questions, and you wonât be told no lies!

   âFew lovers have the privilege enjoyed, my dear, by you,
   Of chopping off a rivalâs head and quartering him too!
   Of vengeance, dear, to-morrow you will surely take your fill!â
   And GILBERT ground his molars as he answered her, âI will!â

   Young GILBERT rose from table with a stern determined look,
   And, frowning, took an inexpensive hatchet from its hook;
   And ANNIE watched his movements with an interested airâ
   For the morrowâfor the morrow he was going to prepare!

   He chipped it with a hammer and he chopped it with a bill,
   He poured sulphuric acid on the edge of it, until
   This terrible Avenger of the Majesty of Law
   Was far less like a hatchet than a dissipated saw.

   And ANNIE said, âO GILBERT, dear, I do not understand
   Why ever you are injuring that hatchet in your hand?â
   He said, âIt is intended for to lacerate and flay
   The neck of that unmitigated villain PETER GRAY!â

   âNow, GILBERT,â ANNIE answered, âwicked headsman, just bewareâ
   I wonât have PETER tortured with that horrible affair;
   If you appear with that, you may depend youâll rue the day.â
   But GILBERT said, âOh, shall I?â which was just his nasty way.

   He saw a look of anger from her eyes distinctly dart,
   For ANNIE was a woman, and had pity in her heart!
   She wished him a good eveningâhe answered with a glare;
   She only said, âRemember, for your ANNIE will be there!â

                             * * * * * * * *

   The morrow GILBERT boldly on the scaffold took his stand,
   With a vizor on his face and with a hatchet in his hand,
   And all the people noticed that the Engine of the Law
   Was far less like a hatchet than a dissipated saw.

   The felon very coolly loosed his collar and his stock,
   And placed his wicked head upon the handy little block.
   The hatchet was uplifted for to settle PETER GRAY,
   When GILBERT plainly heard a womanâs voice exclaiming, âStay!â

   âTwas ANNIE, gentle ANNIE, as youâll easily believe.
   âO GILBERT, you must spare him, for I bring him a reprieve,
   It came from our Home Secretary many weeks ago,
   And passed through that post-office which I used to keep at Bow.

   âI loved you, loved you madly, and you know it, GILBERT CLAY,
   And as Iâd quite surrendered all idea of PETER GRAY,
   I quietly suppressed it, as youâll clearly understand,
   For I thought it might be awkward if he came and claimed my hand.

   âIn anger at my secret (which I could not tell before),
   To lacerate poor PETER GRAY vindictively you swore;
   I told you if you used that blunted axe youâd rue the day,
   And so you will, young GILBERT, for Iâll marry PETER GRAY!â

                                                        [_And so she did_.




AN UNFORTUNATE LIKENESS.


   IâVE painted SHAKESPEARE all my lifeâ
      âAn infantâ (even then at âplayâ!)
   âA boy,â with stage-ambition rife,
      Then âMarried to ANN HATHAWAY.â

   âThe bardâs first ticket nightâ (or âben.â),
      His âFirst appearance on the stage,â
   His âCall before the curtainââthen
      âRejoicings when he came of age.â

   The bard play-writing in his room,
      The bard a humble lawyerâs clerk.
   The bard a lawyer {156a}âparson {156b}âgroom {156c}â
      The bard deer-stealing, after dark.

   The bard a tradesman {156d}âand a Jew {156e}â
      The bard a botanist {156f}âa beak {156g}â
   The bard a skilled musician {156h} tooâ
      A sheriff {156i} and a surgeon {156j} eke!

   Yet critics say (a friendly stock)
      That, though itâs evident I try,
   Yet even _I_ can barely mock
      The glimmer of his wondrous eye!

   One morning as a work I framed,
      There passed a person, walking hard:
   âMy gracious goodness,â I exclaimed,
      âHow very like my dear old bard!

   âOh, what a model he would make!â
      I rushed outsideâimpulsive me!â
   âForgive the liberty I take,
      But youâre so veryâââStop!â said he.

   âYou neednât waste your breath or time,â
      I know what you are going to say,â
   That youâre an artist, and that Iâm
      Remarkably like SHAKESPEARE.  Eh?

   âYou wish that I would sit to you?â
      I clasped him madly round the waist,
   And breathlessly replied, âI do!â
      âAll right,â said he, âbut please make haste.â

   I led him by his hallowed sleeve,
      And worked away at him apace,
   I painted him till dewy eve,â
      There never was a nobler face!

   âOh, sir,â I said, âa fortune grand
      Is yours, by dint of merest chance,â
   To sport _his_ brow at second-hand,
      To wear _his_ cast-off countenance!

   âTo rub _his_ eyes wheneâer they acheâ
      To wear _his_ baldness ere youâre oldâ
   To clean _his_ teeth when you awakeâ
      To blow _his_ nose when youâve a cold!â

   His eyeballs glistened in his eyesâ
      I sat and watched and smoked my pipe;
   âBravo!â I said, âI recognize
      The phrensy of your prototype!â

   His scanty hair he wildly tore:
      âThatâs right,â said I, âit shows your breed.â
   He dancedâhe stampedâhe wildly sworeâ
      âBless me, thatâs very fine indeed!â

   âSir,â said the grand Shakesperian boy
      (Continuing to blaze away),
   âYou think my face a source of joy;
      That shows you know not what you say.

   âForgive these yells and cellar-flaps:
      Iâm always thrown in some such state
   When on his face well-meaning chaps
      This wretched man congratulate.

   âFor, oh! this faceâthis pointed chinâ
      This noseâthis browâthese eyeballs too,
   Have always been the origin
      Of all the woes I ever knew!

   âIf to the play my way I find,
      To see a grand Shakesperian piece,
   I have no rest, no ease of mind
      Until the authorâs puppets cease.

   âMen nudge each otherâthusâand say,
      âThis certainly is SHAKESPEAREâS son,â
   And merry wags (of course in play)
      Cry âAuthor!â when the piece is done.

   âIn church the people stare at me,
      Their soul the sermon never binds;
   I catch them looking round to see,
      And thoughts of SHAKESPEARE fill their minds.

   âAnd sculptors, fraught with cunning wile,
      Who find it difficult to crown
   A bust with BROWNâS insipid smile,
      Or TOMKINSâS unmannered frown,

   âYet boldly make my face their own,
      When (oh, presumption!) they require
   To animate a paving-stone
      With SHAKESPEAREâS intellectual fire.

   âAt parties where young ladies gaze,
      And I attempt to speak my joy,
   âHush, pray,â some lovely creature says,
      âThe fond illusion donât destroy!â

   âWheneâer I speak, my soul is wrung
      With these or some such whisperings:
   ââTis pity that a SHAKESPEAREâS tongue
      Should say such un-Shakesperian things!â

   âI should not thus be criticised
      Had I a face of common wont:
   Donât envy meânow, be advised!â
      And, now I think of it, I donât!




THE KING OF CANOODLE-DUM.


   THE story of FREDERICK GOWLER,
      A mariner of the sea,
   Who quitted his ship, the _Howler_,
      A-sailing in Caribbee.
   For many a day he wandered,
      Till he met in a state of rum
   CALAMITY POP VON PEPPERMINT DROP,
      The King of Canoodle-Dum.

   That monarch addressed him gaily,
      âHum!  Golly de do to-day?
   Hum!  Lily-white Buckra Saileeââ
      (You notice his playful way?)â
   âWhat dickens you doinâ here, sar?
      Why debbil you want to come?
   Hum!  Picaninnee, dere isnât no sea
      In City Canoodle-Dum!â

   And GOWLER he answered sadly,
      âOh, mine is a doleful tale!
   Theyâve treated me werry badly
      In Lunnon, from where I hail.
   Iâm one of the Family Royalâ
      No common Jack Tar you see;
   Iâm WILLIAM THE FOURTH, far up in the North,
      A King in my own countree!â

   Bang-bang!  How the tom-toms thundered!
      Bang-bang!  How they thumped this gongs!
   Bang-bang!  How the people wondered!
      Bang-bang!  At it hammer and tongs!
   Alliance with Kings of Europe
      Is an honour Canoodlers seek,
   Her monarchs donât stop with PEPPERMINT DROP
      Every day in the week!

   FRED told them that he was undone,
      For his people all went insane,
   And fired the Tower of London,
      And Grinnidgeâs Naval Fane.
   And some of them racked St. Jamesâs,
      And vented their rage upon
   The Church of St. Paul, the Fishmongersâ Hall,
      And the Angel at Islington.

   CALAMITY POP implored him
      In his capital to remain
   Till those people of his restored him
      To power and rank again.
   CALAMITY POP he made him
      A Prince of Canoodle-Dum,
   With a couple of caves, some beautiful slaves,
      And the run of the royal rum.

   Pop gave him his only daughter,
      HUM PICKETY WIMPLE TIP:
   FRED vowed that if over the water
      He went, in an English ship,
   Heâd make her his Queen,âthough truly
      It is an unusual thing
   For a Caribbee brat whoâs as black as your hat
      To be wife of an English King.

   And all the Canoodle-Dummers
      They copied his rolling walk,
   His method of draining rummers,
      His emblematical talk.
   For his dress and his graceful breeding,
      His delicate taste in rum,
   And his nautical way, were the talk of the day
      In the Court of Canoodle-Dum.

   CALAMITY POP most wisely
      Determined in everything
   To model his Court precisely
      On that of the English King;
   And ordered that every lady
      And every ladyâs lord
   Should masticate jacky (a kind of tobaccy),
      And scatter its juice abroad.

   They signified wonder roundly
      At any astounding yarn,
   By darning their dear eyes roundly
      (âT was all they had to darn).
   They âhoisted their slacks,â adjusting
      Garments of plantain-leaves
   With nautical twitches (as if they wore breeches,
      Instead of a dress like EVEâS!)

   They shivered their timbers proudly,
      At a phantom forelock dragged,
   And called for a hornpipe loudly
      Whenever amusement flagged.
   âHum!  Golly! him POP resemble,
      Him Britisher sovâreign, hum!
   CALAMITY POP VON PEPPERMINT DROP,
      De King of Canoodle-Dum!â

   The marinerâs lively âHollo!â
      Enlivened Canoodleâs plain
   (For blessings unnumbered follow
      In Civilizationâs train).
   But Fortune, who loves a bathos,
      A terrible ending planned,
   For ADMIRAL D. CHICKABIDDY, C.B.,
      Placed foot on Canoodle land!

   That rebel, he seized KING GOWLER,
      He threatened his royal brains,
   And put him aboard the _Howler_,
      And fastened him down with chains.
   The _Howler_ she weighed her anchor,
      With FREDERICK nicely nailed,
   And off to the North with WILLIAM THE FOURTH
      These horrible pirates sailed.

   CALAMITY said (with folly),
      âHum! nebber want him againâ
   Him civilize all of us, golly!
      CALAMITY suck him brain!â
   The people, however, were pained when
      They saw him aboard his ship,
   But none of them wept for their FREDDY, except
      HUM PICKETY WIMPLE TIP.




THE MARTINET.


   SOME time ago, in simple verse
      I sang the story true
   Of CAPTAIN REECE, the _Mantelpiece_,
      And all her happy crew.

   I showed how any captain may
      Attach his men to him,
   If he but heeds their smallest needs,
      And studies every whim.

   Now mark how, by Draconic rule
      And _hauteur_ ill-advised,
   The noblest crew upon the Blue
      May be demoralized.

   When his ungrateful country placed
      Kind REECE upon half-pay,
   Without much claim SIR BERKELY came,
      And took command one day.

   SIR BERKELY was a martinetâ
      A stern unyielding soulâ
   Who ruled his ship by dint of whip
      And horrible black-hole.

   A sailor who was overcome
      From having freely dined,
   And chanced to reel when at the wheel,
      He instantly confined!

   And tars who, when an action raged,
      Appeared alarmed or scared,
   And those below who wished to go,
      He very seldom spared.

   Eâen he who smote his officer
      For punishment was booked,
   And mutinies upon the seas
      He rarely overlooked.

   In short, the happy _Mantelpiece_,
      Where all had gone so well,
   Beneath that fool SIR BERKELYâS rule
      Became a floating hell.

   When first SIR BERKELY came aboard
      He read a speech to all,
   And told them how heâd made a vow
      To act on dutyâs call.

   Then WILLIAM LEE, he up and said
      (The Captainâs coxswain he),
   âWeâve heard the speech your honourâs made,
      And werry pleased we be.

   âWe wonât pretend, my lad, as how
      Weâre glad to lose our REECE;
   Urbane, polite, he suited quite
      The saucy _Mantelpiece_.

   âBut if your honour gives your mind
      To study all our ways,
   With dance and song weâll jog along
      As in those happy days.

   âI like your honourâs looks, and feel
      Youâre worthy of your sword.
   Your hand, my ladâIâm doosid glad
      To welcome you aboard!â

   SIR BERKELY looked amazed, as though
      He didnât understand.
   âDonât shake your head,â good WILLIAM said,
      âIt is an honest hand.

   âItâs grasped a better hand than yournâ
      Come, govânor, I insist!â
   The Captain staredâthe coxswain glaredâ
      The hand became a fist!

   âDown, upstart!â said the hardy salt;
      But BERKELY dodged his aim,
   And made him go in chains below:
      The seamen murmured âShame!â

   He stopped all songs at 12 p.m.,
      Stopped hornpipes when at sea,
   And swore his cot (or bunk) should not
      Be used by aught than he.

   He never joined their daily mess,
      Nor asked them to his own,
   But chaffed in gay and social way
      The officers alone.

   His First Lieutenant, PETER, was
      As useless as could be,
   A helpless stick, and always sick
      When there was any sea.

   This First Lieutenant proved to be
      His foster-sister MAY,
   Who went to sea for love of he
      In masculine array.

   And when he learnt the curious fact,
      Did he emotion show,
   Or dry her tears or end her fears
      By marrying her?  No!

   Or did he even try to soothe
      This maiden in her teens?
   Oh, no!âinstead he made her wed
      The Sergeant of Marines!

   Of course such Spartan discipline
      Would make an angel fret;
   They drew a lot, and WILLIAM shot
      This fearful martinet.

   The Admiralty saw how ill
      Theyâd treated CAPTAIN REECE;
   He was restored once more aboard
      The saucy _Mantelpiece_.




THE SAILOR BOY TO HIS LASS.


   I GO away this blessed day,
      To sail across the sea, MATILDA!
   My vessel starts for various parts
      At twenty after three, MATILDA.
   I hardly know where we may go,
      Or if itâs near or far, MATILDA,
   For CAPTAIN HYDE does not confide
      In any âfore-mast tar, MATILDA!

   Beneath my ban that mystic man
      Shall suffer, _coÃ»te qui coÃ»te_, MATILDA!
   What right has he to keep from me
      The Admiralty route, MATILDA?
   Because, forsooth! I am a youth
      Of common sailorsâ lot, MATILDA!
   Am I a man on human plan
      Designed, or am I not, MATILDA?

   But there, my lass, weâll let that pass!
      With anxious love I burn, MATILDA.
   I want to know if we shall go
      To church when I return, MATILDA?
   Your eyes are red, you bow your head;
      Itâs pretty clear you thirst, MATILDA,
   To name the dayâWhatâs that you say?
      ââYouâll see me further first,â MATILDA?

   I canât mistake the signs you make,
      Although you barely speak, MATILDA;
   Though pure and young, you thrust your tongue
      Right in your pretty cheek, MATILDA!
   My dear, I fear I hear you sneerâ
      I doâIâm sure I do, MATILDA!
   With simple grace you make a face,
      Ejaculating, âUgh!â MATILDA.

   Oh, pause to think before you drink
      The dregs of Letheâs cup, MATILDA!
   Remember, do, what Iâve gone through,
      Before you give me up, MATILDA!
   Recall again the mental pain
      Of what Iâve had to do, MATILDA!
   And be assured that Iâve endured
      It, all along of you, MATILDA!

   Do you forget, my blithesome pet,
      How once with jealous rage, MATILDA,
   I watched you walk and gaily talk
      With some one thrice your age, MATILDA?
   You squatted free upon his knee,
      A sight that made me sad, MATILDA!
   You pinched his cheek with friendly tweak,
      Which almost drove me mad, MATILDA!

   I knew him not, but hoped to spot
      Some man you thought to wed, MATILDA!
   I took a gun, my darling one,
      And shot him through the head, MATILDA!
   Iâm made of stuff thatâs rough and gruff
      Enough, I own; but, ah, MATILDA!
   It _did_ annoy your sailor boy
      To find it was your pa, MATILDA!

   Iâve passed a life of toil and strife,
      And disappointments deep, MATILDA;
   Iâve lain awake with dental ache
      Until I fell asleep, MATILDA!
   At times again Iâve missed a train,
      Or pârhaps run short of tin, MATILDA,
   And worn a boot on corns that shoot,
      Or, shaving, cut my chin, MATILDA.

   But, oh! no trainsâno dental painsâ
      Believe me when I say, MATILDA,
   No corns that shootâno pinching boot
      Upon a summer day, MATILDAâ
   Itâs my belief, could cause such grief
      As that Iâve suffered for, MATILDA,
   My having shot in vital spot
      Your old progenitor, MATILDA.

   Bethink you how Iâve kept the vow
      I made one winter day, MATILDAâ
   That, come what could, I never would
      Remain too long away, MATILDA.
   And, oh! the crimes with which, at times,
      Iâve charged my gentle mind, MATILDA,
   To keep the vow I madeâand now
      You treat me so unkind, MATILDA!

   For when at sea, off Caribbee,
      I felt my passion burn, MATILDA,
   By passion egged, I went and begged
      The captain to return, MATILDA.
   And when, my pet, I couldnât get
      That captain to agree, MATILDA,
   Right through a sort of open port
      I pitched him in the sea, MATILDA!

   Remember, too, how all the crew
      With indignation blind, MATILDA,
   Distinctly swore they neâer before
      Had thought me so unkind, MATILDA.
   And how theyâd shun me one by oneâ
      An unforgiving group, MATILDAâ
   I stopped their howls and sulky scowls
      By pizening their soup, MATILDA!

   So pause to think, before you drink
      The dregs of Letheâs cup, MATILDA;
   Remember, do, what Iâve gone through,
      Before you give me up, MATILDA.
   Recall again the mental pain
      Of what Iâve had to do, MATILDA,
   And be assured that Iâve endured
      It, all along of you, MATILDA!




THE REVEREND SIMON MAGUS.


   A RICH advowson, highly prized,
   For private sale was advertised;
   And many a parson made a bid;
   The REVEREND SIMON MAGUS did.

   He sought the agentâs: âAgent, I
   Have come prepared at once to buy
   (If your demand is not too big)
   The Cure of Otium-cum-Digge.â

   âAh!â said the agent, â_thereâs_ a berthâ
   The snuggest vicarage on earth;
   No sort of duty (so I hear),
   And fifteen hundred pounds a year!

   âIf on the price we should agree,
   The living soon will vacant be;
   The good incumbentâs ninety five,
   And cannot very long survive.

   âSeeâhereâs his photographâyou see,
   Heâs in his dotage.â  âAh, dear me!
   Poor soul!â said SIMON.  âHis decease
   Would be a merciful release!â

   The agent laughedâthe agent blinkedâ
   The agent blew his nose and winkedâ
   And poked the parsonâs ribs in playâ
   It was that agentâs vulgar way.

   The REVEREND SIMON frowned: âI grieve
   This light demeanour to perceive;
   Itâs scarcely _comme il faut_, I think:
   Nowâpray oblige meâdo not wink.

   âDonât dig my waistcoat into holesâ
   Your mission is to sell the souls
   Of human sheep and human kids
   To that divine who highest bids.

   âDo well in this, and on your head
   Unnumbered honours will be shed.â
   The agent said, âWell, truth to tell,
   I _have_ been doing very well.â

   âYou should,â said SIMON, âat your age;
   But now about the parsonage.
   How many rooms does it contain?
   Show me the photograph again.

   âA poor apostleâs humble house
   Must not be too luxurious;
   No stately halls with oaken floorâ
   It should be decent and no more.

   âNo billiard-roomsâno stately treesâ
   No croquÃªt-grounds or pineries.â
   âAh!â sighed the agent, âvery true:
   This property wonât do for you.â

   âAll these about the house youâll find.ââ
   âWell,â said the parson, ânever mind;
   Iâll manage to submit to these
   Luxurious superfluities.

   âA clergyman who does not shirk
   The various calls of Christian work,
   Will have no leisure to employ
   These âcommon formsâ of worldly joy.

   âTo preach three times on Sabbath daysâ
   To wean the lost from wicked waysâ
   The sick to sootheâthe sane to wedâ
   The poor to feed with meat and bread;

   âThese are the various wholesome ways
   In which Iâll spend my nights and days:
   My zeal will have no time to cool
   At croquÃªt, archery, or pool.â

   The agent said, âFrom what I hear,
   This living will not suit, I fearâ
   There are no poor, no sick at all;
   For services there is no call.â

   The reverend gent looked grave, âDear me!
   Then there is _no_ âsocietyâ?â
   I mean, of course, no sinners there
   Whose souls will be my special care?â

   The cunning agent shook his head,
   âNo, noneâexceptââ(the agent said)â
   âThe DUKE OF A., the EARL OF B.,
   The MARQUIS C., and VISCOUNT D.

   âBut you will not be quite alone,
   For though theyâve chaplains of their own,
   Of course this noble well-bred clan
   Receive the parish clergyman.â

   âOh, silence, sir!â said SIMON M.,
   âDukesâEarls!  What should I care for them?
   These worldly ranks I scorn and flout!â
   âOf course,â the agent said, âno doubt!â

   âYet I might show these men of birth
   The hollowness of rank on earth.â
   The agent answered, âVery trueâ
   But I should not, if I were you.â

   âWho sells this rich advowson, pray?â
   The agent winkedâit was his wayâ
   âHis name is HART; âtwixt me and you,
   He is, Iâm grieved to say, a Jew!â

   âA Jew?â said SIMON, âhappy find!
   I purchase this advowson, mind.
   My life shall be devoted to
   Converting that unhappy Jew!â




MY DREAM.


   THE other night, from cares exempt,
   I sleptâand what dâyou think I dreamt?
   I dreamt that somehow I had come
   To dwell in Topsy-Turveydomâ

   Where vice is virtueâvirtue, vice:
   Where nice is nastyânasty, nice:
   Where right is wrong and wrong is rightâ
   Where white is black and black is white.

   Where babies, much to their surprise,
   Are born astonishingly wise;
   With every Science on their lips,
   And Art at all their finger-tips.

   For, as their nurses dandle them
   They crow binomial theorem,
   With views (it seems absurd to us)
   On differential calculus.

   But though a babe, as I have said,
   Is born with learning in his head,
   He must forget it, if he can,
   Before he calls himself a man.

   For that which we call folly here,
   Is wisdom in that favoured sphere;
   The wisdom we so highly prize
   Is blatant folly in their eyes.

   A boy, if he would push his way,
   Must learn some nonsense every day;
   And cut, to carry out this view,
   His wisdom teeth and wisdom too.

   Historians burn their midnight oils,
   Intent on giant-killersâ toils;
   And sages close their aged eyes
   To other sagesâ lullabies.

   Our magistrates, in duty bound,
   Commit all robbers who are found;
   But there the Beaks (so people said)
   Commit all robberies instead.

   Our Judges, pure and wise in tone,
   Know crime from theory alone,
   And glean the motives of a thief
   From books and popular belief.

   But there, a Judge who wants to prime
   His mind with true ideas of crime,
   Derives them from the common sense
   Of practical experience.

   Policemen march all folks away
   Who practise virtue every dayâ
   Of course, I mean to say, you know,
   What we call virtue here below.

   For only scoundrels dare to do
   What we consider just and true,
   And only good men do, in fact,
   What we should think a dirty act.

   But strangest of these social twirls,
   The girls are boysâthe boys are girls!
   The men are women, tooâbut then,
   _Per contra_, women all are men.

   To one who to tradition clings
   This seems an awkward state of things,
   But if to think it out you try,
   It doesnât really signify.

   With them, as surely as can be,
   A sailor should be sick at sea,
   And not a passenger may sail
   Who cannot smoke right through a gale.

   A soldier (save by rarest luck)
   Is always shot for showing pluck
   (That is, if others can be found
   With pluck enough to fire a round).

   âHow strange!â I said to one I saw;
   âYou quite upset our every law.
   However can you get along
   So systematically wrong?â

   âDear me!â my mad informant said,
   âHave you no eyes within your head?
   You sneer when you your hat should doff:
   Why, we begin where you leave off!

   âYour wisest men are very far
   Less learned than our babies are!â
   I mused awhileâand then, oh me!
   I framed this brilliant repartee:

   âAlthough your babes are wiser far
   Than our most valued sages are,
   Your sages, with their toys and cots,
   Are duller than our idiots!â

   But this remark, I grieve to state,
   Came just a little bit too late
   For as I framed it in my head,
   I woke and found myself in bed.

   Still I could wish that, âstead of here,
   My lot were in that favoured sphere!â
   Where greatest fools bear off the bell
   I ought to do extremely well.




THE BISHOP OF RUM-TI-FOO AGAIN.


   I OFTEN wonder whether you
   Think sometimes of that Bishop, who
   From black but balmy Rum-ti-Foo
      Last summer twelvemonth came.
   Unto your mind I pârâaps may bring
   Remembrance of the man I sing
   To-day, by simply mentioning
      That PETER was his name.

   Remember how that holy man
   Came with the great Colonial clan
   To Synod, called Pan-Anglican;
      And kindly recollect
   How, having crossed the ocean wide,
   To please his flock all means he tried
   Consistent with a proper pride
      And manly self-respect.

   He only, of the reverend pack
   Who minister to Christians black,
   Brought any useful knowledge back
      To his Colonial fold.
   In consequence a place I claim
   For âPETERâ on the scroll of Fame
   (For PETER was that Bishopâs name,
      As Iâve already told).

   He carried Art, he often said,
   To places where that timid maid
   (Save by Colonial Bishopsâ aid)
      Could never hope to roam.
   The Payne-cum-Lauri feat he taught
   As he had learnt it; for he thought
   The choicest fruits of Progress ought
      To bless the Negroâs home.

   And he had other work to do,
   For, while he tossed upon the Blue,
   The islanders of Rum-ti-Foo
      Forgot their kindly friend.
   Their decent clothes they learnt to tearâ
   They learnt to say, âI do not care,â
   Though they, of course, were well aware
      How folks, who say so, end.

   Some sailors, whom he did not know,
   Had landed there not long ago,
   And taught them âBother!â also, âBlow!â
      (Of wickedness the germs).
   No need to use a casuistâs pen
   To prove that they were merchantmen;
   No sailor of the Royal N.
      Would use such awful terms.

   And so, when BISHOP PETER came
   (That was the kindly Bishopâs name),
   He heard these dreadful oaths with shame,
      And chid their want of dress.
   (Except a shellâa bangle rareâ
   A feather hereâa feather there
   The South Pacific Negroes wear
      Their native nothingness.)

   He taught them that a Bishop loathes
   To listen to disgraceful oaths,
   He gave them all his left-off clothesâ
      They bent them to his will.
   The Bishopâs gift spreads quickly round;
   In PETERâS left-off clothes they bound
   (His three-and-twenty suits they found
      In fair condition still).

   The Bishopâs eyes with water fill,
   Quite overjoyed to find them still
   Obedient to his sovereign will,
      And said, âGood Rum-ti-Foo!
   Half-way Iâll meet you, I declare:
   Iâll dress myself in cowries rare,
   And fasten feathers in my hair,
      And dance the âCutch-chi-boo!ââ {192}

   And to conciliate his See
   He married PICCADILLILLEE,
   The youngest of his twenty-three,
      Tallâneither fat nor thin.
   (And though the dress he made her don
   Looks awkwardly a girl upon,
   It was a great improvement on
      The one he found her in.)

   The Bishop in his gay canoe
   (His wife, of course, went with him too)
   To some adjacent island flew,
      To spend his honeymoon.
   Some day in sunny Rum-ti-Foo
   A little PETERâll be on view;
   And that (if people tell me true)
      Is like to happen soon.




THE HAUGHTY ACTOR.


      AN actorâGIBBS, of Drury Laneâ
         Of very decent station,
      Once happened in a part to gain
         Excessive approbation:
      It sometimes turns a fellowâs brain
      And makes him singularly vain
   When he believes that he receives
         Tremendous approbation.

      His great success half drove him mad,
         But no one seemed to mind him;
      Well, in another piece he had
         Another part assigned him.
      This part was smaller, by a bit,
      Than that in which he made a hit.
   So, much ill-used, he straight refused
         To play the part assigned him.

                             * * * * * * * *

   _That night that actor slept_, _and Iâll attempt_
   _To tell you of the vivid dream he dreamt_.

                                THE DREAM.

      In fighting with a robber band
         (A thing he loved sincerely)
      A sword struck GIBBS upon the hand,
         And wounded it severely.
      At first he didnât heed it much,
      He thought it was a simple touch,
   But soon he found the weaponâs bound
         Had wounded him severely.

      To Surgeon COBB he made a trip,
         Whoâd just effected featly
      An amputation at the hip
         Particularly neatly.
      A rising man was Surgeon COBB
      But this extremely ticklish job
   He had achieved (as he believed)
         Particularly neatly.

      The actor rang the surgeonâs bell.
         âObserve my wounded finger,
      Be good enough to strap it well,
         And prithee do not linger.
      That I, dear sir, may fill again
      The Theatre Royal Drury Lane:
   This very night I have to fightâ
         So prithee do not linger.â

      âI donât strap fingers up for doles,â
         Replied the haughty surgeon;
      âTo use your cant, I donât play _rÃ´les_
         Utility that verge on.
      First amputationânothing lessâ
      That is my line of business:
   We surgeon nobs despise all jobs
         Utility that verge on

      âWhen in your hip there lurks diseaseâ
         (So dreamt this lively dreamer),
      âOr devastating _caries_
         In _humerus_ or _femur_,
      If you can pay a handsome fee,
      Oh, then you may remember meâ
   With joy elate Iâll amputate
         Your _humerus_ or _femur_.â

      The disconcerted actor ceased
         The haughty leech to pester,
      But when the wound in size increased,
         And then began to fester,
      He sought a learned Counselâs lair,
      And told that Counsel, then and there,
   How COBBâS neglect of his defect
         Had made his finger fester.

      âOh, bring my action, if you please,
         The case I pray you urge on,
      And win me thumping damages
         From COBB, that haughty surgeon.
      He culpably neglected me
      Although I proffered him his fee,
   So pray come down, in wig and gown,
         On COBB, that haughty surgeon!â

      That Counsel learned in the laws,
         With passion almost trembled.
      He just had gained a mighty cause
         Before the Peers assembled!
      Said he, âHow dare you have the face
      To come with Common Jury case
   To one who wings rhetoric flings
         Before the Peers assembled?â

      Dispirited became our friendâ
         Depressed his moral peckerâ
      âBut stay! a thought!âIâll gain my end,
         And save my poor exchequer.
      I wonât be placed upon the shelf,
      Iâll take it into Court myself,
   And legal lore display before
         The Court of the Exchequer.â

      He found a Baronâone of those
         Who with our laws supply usâ
      In wig and silken gown and hose,
         As if at _Nisi Prius_.
      But heâd just given, off the reel,
      A famous judgment on Appeal:
   It scarce became his heightened fame
         To sit at _Nisi Prius_.

      Our friend began, with easy wit,
         That half concealed his terror:
      âPooh!â said the Judge, âI only sit
         In _Banco_ or in Error.
      Can you suppose, my man, that Iâd
      Oâer _Nisi Prius_ Courts preside,
   Or condescend my time to spend
         On anything but Error?â

      âToo bad,â said GIBBS, âmy case to shirk!
      You must be bad innately,
   To save your skill for mighty work
      Because itâs valued greatly!â
   But here he woke, with sudden start.

                             * * * * * * * *

      He wrote to say heâd play the part.
   Iâve but to tell he played it wellâ
      The authorâs wordsâhis native wit
      Combined, achieved a perfect âhitââ
         The papers praised him greatly.




THE TWO MAJORS.


   AN excellent soldier whoâs worthy the name
      Loves officers dashing and strict:
   When good, heâs content with escaping all blame,
      When naughty, he likes to be licked.

   He likes for a fault to be bullied and stormed,
      Or imprisoned for several days,
   And hates, for a duty correctly performed,
      To be slavered with sickening praise.

   No officer sickened with praises his _corps_
      So little as MAJOR LA GUERREâ
   No officer swore at his warriors more
      Than MAJOR MAKREDI PREPERE.

   Their soldiers adored them, and every grade
      Delighted to hear their abuse;
   Though whenever these officers came on parade
      They shivered and shook in their shoes.

   For, oh! if LA GUERRE could all praises withhold,
      Why, so could MAKREDI PREPERE,
   And, oh! if MAKREDI could bluster and scold,
      Why, so could the mighty LA GUERRE.

   âNo doubt we deserve itâno mercy we craveâ
      Go onâyouâre conferring a boon;
   We would rather be slanged by a warrior brave,
      Than praised by a wretched poltroon!â

   MAKREDI would say that in battleâs fierce rage
      True happiness only was met:
   Poor MAJOR MAKREDI, though fifty his age,
      Had never known happiness yet!

   LA GUERRE would declare, âWith the blood of a foe
      No tipple is worthy to clink.â
   Poor fellow! he hadnât, though sixty or so,
      Yet tasted his favourite drink!

   They agreed at their messâthey agreed in the glassâ
      They agreed in the choice of their âset,â
   And they also agreed in adoring, alas!
      The VivandiÃ¨re, pretty FILLETTE.

   Agreement, you see, may be carried too far,
      And after agreeing all round
   For yearsâin this soldierly âmaid of the bar,â
      A bone of contention they found!

   It may seem improper to call such a petâ
      By a metaphor, evenâa bone;
   But though they agreed in adoring her, yet
      Each wanted to make her his own.

   âOn the day that you marry her,â muttered PREPERE
      (With a pistol he quietly played),
   âIâll scatter the brains in your noddle, I swear,
      All over the stony parade!â

   âI cannot do _that_ to you,â answered LA GUERRE,
      âWhatever events may befall;
   But this _I can_ doâ_if you_ wed her, _mon cher_!
      Iâll eat you, moustachios and all!â

   The rivals, although they would never engage,
      Yet quarrelled whenever they met;
   They met in a fury and left in a rage,
      But neither took pretty FILLETTE.

   âI am not afraid,â thought MAKREDI PREPERE:
      âFor country Iâm ready to fall;
   But nobody wants, for a mere VivandiÃ¨re,
      To be eaten, moustachios and all!

   âBesides, though LA GUERRE has his faults, Iâll allow
      Heâs one of the bravest of men:
   My goodness! if I disagree with him now,
      I might disagree with him then.â

   âNo coward am I,â said LA GUERRE, âas you guessâ
      I sneer at an enemyâs blade;
   But I donât want PREPERE to get into a mess
      For splashing the stony parade!â

   One day on parade to PREPERE and LA GUERRE
      Came CORPORAL JACOT DEBETTE,
   And trembling all over, he prayed of them there
      To give him the pretty FILLETTE.

   âYou see, I am willing to marry my bride
      Until youâve arranged this affair;
   I will blow out my brains when your honours decide
      Which marries the sweet VivandiÃ¨re!â

   âWell, take her,â said both of them in a duet
      (A favourite form of reply),
   âBut when I am ready to marry FILLETTE.
      Remember youâve promised to die!â

   He married her then: from the flowery plains
      Of existence the roses they cull:
   He lived and he died with his wife; and his brains
      Are reposing in peace in his skull.




EMILY, JOHN, JAMES, AND I.
A DERBY LEGEND.


   EMILY JANE was a nursery maid,
      JAMES was a bold Life Guard,
   JOHN was a constable, poorly paid
      (And I am a doggerel bard).

   A very good girl was EMILY JANE,
      JIMMY was good and true,
   JOHN was a very good man in the main
      (And I am a good man too).

   Rivals for EMMIE were JOHNNY and JAMES,
      Though EMILY liked them both;
   She couldnât tell which had the strongest claims
      (And _I_ couldnât take my oath).

   But sooner or later youâre certain to find
      Your sentiments canât lie hidâ
   JANE thought it was time that she made up her mind
      (And I think it was time she did).

   Said JANE, with a smirk, and a blush on her face,
      âIâll promise to wed the boy
   Who takes me to-morrow to Epsom Race!â
      (Which I would have done, with joy).

   From JOHNNY escaped an expression of pain,
      But Jimmy said, âDone with you!
   Iâll take you with pleasure, my EMILY JANE!â
      (And I would have said so too).

   JOHN lay on the ground, and he roared like mad
      (For JOHNNY was sore perplexed),
   And he kicked very hard at a very small lad
      (Which _I_ often do, when vexed).

   For JOHN was on duty next day with the Force,
      To punish all Epsom crimes;
   Young people _will_ cross when theyâre clearing the course
      (I do it myself, sometimes).

                             * * * * * * * *

   The Derby Day sun glittered gaily on cads,
      On maidens with gamboge hair,
   On sharpers and pickpockets, swindlers and pads,
      (For I, with my harp, was there).

   And JIMMY went down with his JANE that day,
      And JOHN by the collar or nape
   Seized everybody who came in his way
      (And _I_ had a narrow escape).

   He noticed his EMILY JANE with JIM,
      And envied the well-made elf;
   And people remarked that he muttered âOh, dim!â
      (I often say âdim!â myself).

   JOHN dogged them all day, without asking their leaves;
      For his sergeant he told, aside,
   That JIMMY and JANE were notorious thieves
      (And I think he was justified).

   But JAMES wouldnât dream of abstracting a fork,
      And JENNY would blush with shame
   At stealing so much as a bottle or cork
      (A bottle I think fair game).

   But, ah! thereâs another more serious crime!
      They wickedly strayed upon
   The course, at a critical moment of time
      (I pointed them out to JOHN).

   The constable fell on the pair in a crackâ
      And then, with a demon smile,
   Let JENNY cross over, but sent JIMMY back
      (I played on my harp the while).

   Stern JOHNNY their agony loud derides
      With a very triumphant sneerâ
   They weep and they wail from the opposite sides
      (And _I_ shed a silent tear).

   And JENNY is crying away like mad,
      And JIMMY is swearing hard;
   And JOHNNY is looking uncommonly glad
      (And I am a doggerel bard).

   But JIMMY he ventured on crossing again
      The scenes of our Isthmian Gamesâ
   JOHN caught him, and collared him, giving him pain
      (I felt very much for JAMES).

   JOHN led him away with a victorâs hand,
      And JIMMY was shortly seen
   In the station-house under the grand Grand Stand
      (As many a time _Iâve_ been).

   And JIMMY, bad boy, was imprisoned for life,
      Though EMILY pleaded hard;
   And JOHNNY had EMILY JANE to wife
      (And I am a doggerel bard).




THE PERILS OF INVISIBILITY.


   OLD PETER led a wretched lifeâ
   Old PETER had a furious wife;
   Old PETER too was truly stout,
   He measured several yards about.

   The little fairy PICKLEKIN
   One summer afternoon looked in,
   And said, âOld PETER, how de do?
   Can I do anything for you?

   âI have three giftsâthe first will give
   Unbounded riches while you live;
   The second health whereâer you be;
   The third, invisibility.â

   âO little fairy PICKLEKIN,â
   Old PETER answered with a grin,
   âTo hesitate would be absurd,â
   Undoubtedly I choose the third.â

   ââTis yours,â the fairy said; âbe quite
   Invisible to mortal sight
   Wheneâer you please.  Remember me
   Most kindly, pray, to MRS. P.â

   Old MRS. PETER overheard
   Wee PICKLEKINâS concluding word,
   And, jealous of her girlhoodâs choice,
   Said, âThat was some young womanâs voice!â

   Old PETER let her scold and swearâ
   Old PETER, bless him, didnât care.
   âMy dear, your rage is wasted quiteâ
   Observe, I disappear from sight!â

   A well-bred fairy (so Iâve heard)
   Is always faithful to her word:
   Old PETER vanished like a shot,
   Put thenâ_his suit of clothes did not_!

   For when conferred the fairy slim
   Invisibility on _him_,
   She popped away on fairy wings,
   Without referring to his âthings.â

   So there remained a coat of blue,
   A vest and double eyeglass too,
   His tail, his shoes, his socks as well,
   His pair ofâno, I must not tell.

   Old MRS. PETER soon began
   To see the failure of his plan,
   And then resolved (I quote the Bard)
   To âhoist him with his own petard.â

   Old PETER woke next day and dressed,
   Put on his coat, and shoes, and vest,
   His shirt and stock; _but could not find_
   _His only pair of_ânever mind!

   Old PETER was a decent man,
   And though he twigged his ladyâs plan,
   Yet, hearing her approaching, he
   Resumed invisibility.

   âDear MRS. P., my only joy,â
   Exclaimed the horrified old boy,
   âNow, give them up, I beg of youâ
   You know what Iâm referring to!â

   But no; the cross old lady swore
   Sheâd keep hisâwhat I said beforeâ
   To make him publicly absurd;
   And MRS. PETER kept her word.

   The poor old fellow had no rest;
   His coat, his stick, his shoes, his vest,
   Were all that now met mortal eyeâ
   The rest, invisibility!

   âNow, madam, give them up, I begâ
   Iâve had rheumatics in my leg;
   Besides, until you do, itâs plain
   I cannot come to sight again!

   âFor though some mirth it might afford
   To see my clothes without their lord,
   Yet there would rise indignant oaths
   If he were seen without his clothes!â

   But no; resolved to have her quiz,
   The lady held her ownâand hisâ
   And PETER left his humble cot
   To find a pair ofâyou know what.

   Butâhereâs the worst of the affairâ
   Wheneâer he came across a pair
   Already placed for him to don,
   He was too stout to get them on!

   So he resolved at once to train,
   And walked and walked with all his main;
   For years he paced this mortal earth,
   To bring himself to decent girth.

   At night, when all around is still,
   Youâll find him pounding up a hill;
   And shrieking peasants whom he meets,
   Fall down in terror on the peats!

   Old PETER walks through wind and rain,
   Resolved to train, and train, and train,
   Until he weighs twelve stoneâ or soâ
   And when he does, Iâll let you know.




THE MYSTIC SELVAGEE.


   Perhaps already you may know
   SIR BLENNERHASSET PORTICO?
   A Captain in the Navy, heâ
   A Baronet and K.C.B.
            You do?  I thought so!
   It was that Captainâs favourite whim
   (A notion not confined to him)
   That RODNEY was the greatest tar
   Who ever wielded capstan-bar.
            He had been taught so.

   âBENBOW!  CORNWALLIS!  HOOD!âBelay!
   Compared with RODNEYââhe would sayâ
   âNo other tar is worth a rap!
   The great LORD RODNEY was the chap
            The French to polish!
   Though, mind you, I respect LORD HOOD;
   CORNWALLIS, too, was rather good;
   BENBOW could enemies repel,
   LORD NELSON, too, was pretty wellâ
            That is, tol-lol-ish!â

   SIR BLENNERHASSET spent his days
   In learning RODNEYâS little ways,
   And closely imitated, too,
   His mode of talking to his crewâ
            His port and paces.
   An ancient tar he tried to catch
   Whoâd served in RODNEYâS famous batch;
   But since his time long years have fled,
   And RODNEYâS tars are mostly dead:
            _Eheu fugaces_!

   But after searching near and far,
   At last he found an ancient tar
   Who served with RODNEY and his crew
   Against the French in âEighty-two,
            (That gained the peerage).
   He gave him fifty pounds a year,
   His rum, his baccy, and his beer;
   And had a comfortable den
   Rigged up in what, by merchantmen,
            Is called the steerage.

   âNow, JASPERââât was that sailorâs nameâ
   âDonât fear that youâll incur my blame
   By saying, when it seems to you,
   That there is anything I do
            That RODNEY wouldnât.â
   The ancient sailor turned his quid,
   Prepared to do as he was bid:
   âAy, ay, yer honour; to begin,
   Youâve done away with âswifting inââ
            Well, sir, you shouldnât!

   âUpon your spars I see youâve clapped
   Peak halliard blocks, all iron-capped.
   I would not christen that a crime,
   But âtwas not done in RODNEYâS time.
            It looks half-witted!
   Upon your maintop-stay, I see,
   You always clap a selvagee!
   Your stays, I see, are equalizedâ
   No vessel, such as RODNEY prized,
            Would thus be fitted!

   âAnd RODNEY, honoured sir, would grin
   To see you turning deadeyes in,
   Not _up_, as in the ancient way,
   But downwards, like a cutterâs stayâ
            You didnât oughter;
   Besides, in seizing shrouds on board,
   Breast backstays you have quite ignored;
   Great RODNEY kept unto the last
   Breast backstays on topgallant mastâ
            They make it tauter.â

   SIR BLENNERHASSET âswifted in,â
   Turned deadeyes up, and lent a fin
   To strip (as told by JASPER KNOX)
   The iron capping from his blocks,
            Where there was any.
   SIR BLENNERHASSET does away,
   With selvagees from maintop-stay;
   And though it makes his sailors stare,
   He rigs breast backstays everywhereâ
            In fact, too many.

   One morning, when the saucy craft
   Lay calmed, old JASPER toddled aft.
   âMy mind misgives me, sir, that we
   Were wrong about that selvageeâ
            I should restore it.â
   âGood,â said the Captain, and that day
   Restored it to the maintop-stay.
   Well-practised sailors often make
   A much more serious mistake,
            And then ignore it.

   Next day old JASPER came once more:
   âI think, sir, I was right before.â
   Well, up the mast the sailors skipped,
   The selvagee was soon unshipped,
            And all were merry.
   Again a day, and JASPER came:
   âI pârâaps deserve your honourâs blame,
   I canât make up my mind,â said he,
   âAbout that cursed selvageeâ
            Itâs foolishâvery.

   âOn Monday night I could have sworn
   That maintop-stay it should adorn,
   On Tuesday morning I could swear
   That selvagee should not be there.
            The knotâs a rasper!â
   âOh, you be hanged,â said CAPTAIN P.,
   âHere, go ashore at Caribbee.
   Get outâgood byeâshove offâall right!â
   Old JASPER soon was out of sightâ
            Farewell, old JASPER!




PHRENOLOGY.


   âCOME, collar this bad manâ
      Around the throat he knotted me
   Till I to choke beganâ
      In point of fact, garotted me!â

   So spake SIR HERBERT WHITE
      To JAMES, Policeman Thirty-twoâ
   All ruffled with his fight
      SIR HERBERT was, and dirty too.

   Policeman nothing said
      (Though he had much to say on it),
   But from the bad manâs head
      He took the cap that lay on it.

   âNo, great SIR HERBERT WHITEâ
      Impossible to take him up.
   This man is honest quiteâ
      Wherever did you rake him up?

   âFor Burglars, Thieves, and Co.,
      Indeed, Iâm no apologist,
   But I, some years ago,
      Assisted a Phrenologist.

   âObserve his various bumps,
      His head as I uncover it:
   His morals lie in lumps
      All round about and over it.â

   âNow take him,â said SIR WHITE,
      âOr you will soon be rueing it;
   Bless me!  I must be right,â
      I caught the fellow doing it!â

   Policeman calmly smiled,
      âIndeed you are mistaken, sir,
   Youâre agitatedâriledâ
      And very badly shaken, sir.

   âSit down, and Iâll explain
      My system of Phrenology,
   A second, please, remainââ
      (A second is horology).

   Policeman left his beatâ
      (The Bart., no longer furious,
   Sat down upon a seat,
      Observing, âThis is curious!â)

   âOh, surely, here are signs
      Should soften your rigidity:
   This gentleman combines
      Politeness with timidity.

   âOf Shyness hereâs a lumpâ
      A hole for Animosityâ
   And like my fist his bump
      Of Impecuniosity.

   âJust here the bump appears
      Of Innocent Hilarity,
   And just behind his ears
      Are Faith, and Hope, and Charity.

   âHe of true Christian ways
      As bright example sent us isâ
   This maxim he obeys,
      â_Sorte tuÃ¢ contentus sis_.â

   âThere, let him go his ways,
      He needs no stern admonishing.â
   The Bart., in blank amaze,
      Exclaimed, âThis is astonishing!

   âI _must_ have made a mull,
      This matter Iâve been blind in it:
   Examine, please, _my_ skull,
      And tell me what you find in it.â

   That Crusher looked, and said,
      With unimpaired urbanity,
   âSIR HERBERT, youâve a head
      That teems with inhumanity.

   âHereâs Murder, Envy, Strife
      (Propensity to kill any),
   And Lies as large as life,
      And heaps of Social Villany.

   âHereâs Love of Bran-New Clothes,
      EmbezzlingâArsonâDeismâ
   A taste for Slang and Oaths,
      And Fraudulent Trusteeism.

   âHereâs Love of Groundless Chargeâ
      Hereâs Malice, too, and Trickery,
   Unusually large
      Your bump of Pocket-Pickeryââ

   âStop!â said the Bart., âmy cup
      Is fullâIâm worse than him in all;
   Policeman, take me upâ
      No doubt I am some criminal!â

   That Pleecemanâs scorn grew large
      (Phrenology had nettled it),
   He took that Bart. in chargeâ
      I donât know how they settled it.




THE FAIRY CURATE.


         ONCE a fairy
         Light and airy
   Married with a mortal;
         Men, however,
         Never, never
   Pass the fairy portal.
         Slyly stealing,
         She to Ealing
   Made a daily journey;
         There she found him,
         Clients round him
   (He was an attorney).

         Long they tarried,
         Then they married.
   When the ceremony
         Once was ended,
         Off they wended
   On their moon of honey.
         Twelvemonth, maybe,
         Saw a baby
   (Friends performed an orgie).
         Much they prized him,
         And baptized him
   By the name of GEORGIE,

         GEORGIE grew up;
         Then he flew up
   To his fairy mother.
         Happy meetingâ
         Pleasant greetingâ
   Kissing one another.
         âChoose a calling
         Most enthralling,
   I sincerely urge ye.â
         âMother,â said he
         (Revârence made he),
   âI would join the clergy.

         âGive permission
         In additionâ
   Pa will let me do it:
         Thereâs a living
         In his givingâ
   Heâll appoint me to it.
         Dreams of coffâring,
         Easter offâring,
   Tithe and rent and pew-rate,
         So inflame me
         (Do not blame me),
   That Iâll be a curate.â

         She, with pleasure,
         Said, âMy treasure,
   âT is my wish precisely.
         Do your duty,
         Thereâs a beauty;
   You have chosen wisely.
         Tell your father
         I would rather
   As a churchman rank you.
         You, in clover,
         Iâll watch over.â
   GEORGIE said, âOh, thank you!â

         GEORGIE scudded,
         Went and studied,
   Made all preparations,
         And with credit
         (Though he said it)
   Passed examinations.
         (Do not quarrel
         With him, moral,
   Scrupulous digestionsâ
         âTwas his mother,
         And no other,
   Answered all the questions.)

         Time proceeded;
         Little needed
   GEORGIE admonition:
         He, elated,
         Vindicated
   Clergymanâs position.
         People round him
         Always found him
   Plain and unpretending;
         Kindly teaching,
         Plainly preaching,
   All his money lending.

         So the fairy,
         Wise and wary,
   Felt no sorrow risingâ
         No occasion
         For persuasion,
   Warning, or advising.
         He, resuming
         Fairy pluming
   (Thatâs not English, is it?)
         Oft would fly up,
         To the sky up,
   Pay mamma a visit.

                             * * * * * * * *

         Time progressing,
         GEORGIEâS blessing
   Grew more Ritualisticâ
         Popish scandals,
         Tonsuresâsandalsâ
   Genuflections mystic;
         Gushing meetingsâ
         Bosom-beatingsâ
   Heavenly ecstaticsâ
         Broidered spencersâ
         Copes and censersâ
   Rochets and dalmatics.

         This quandary
         Vexed the fairyâ
   Flew she down to Ealing.
         âGEORGIE, stop it!
         Pray you, drop it;
   Hark to my appealing:
         To this foolish
         Papal rule-ish
   Twaddle put an ending;
         This a swerve is
         From our Service
   Plain and unpretending.â

         He, replying,
         Answered, sighing,
   Hawing, hemming, humming,
         âItâs a pityâ
         Theyâre so pritty;
   Yet in mode becoming,
         Mother tender,
         Iâll surrenderâ
   Iâll be unaffectedââ
         But his Bishop
         Into _his_ shop
   Entered unexpected!

         âWho is this, sir,â
         Ballet miss, sir?â
   Said the Bishop coldly.
         ââT is my mother,
         And no other,â
   GEORGIE answered boldly.
         âGo along, sir!
         You are wrong, sir;
   You have years in plenty,
         While this hussy
         (Gracious mussy!)
   Isnât two and twenty!â

         (Fairies clever
         Never, never
   Grow in visage older;
         And the fairy,
         All unwary,
   Leant upon his shoulder!)
         Bishop grieved him,
         Disbelieved him;
   GEORGE the point grew warm on;
         Changed religion,
         Like a pigeon, {233}
   And became a Mormon!




THE WAY OF WOOING.


   A MAIDEN sat at her window wide,
   Pretty enough for a Princeâs bride,
      Yet nobody came to claim her.
   She sat like a beautiful picture there,
   With pretty bluebells and roses fair,
      And jasmine-leaves to frame her.
   And why she sat there nobody knows;
   But this she sang as she plucked a rose,
      The leaves around her strewing:
   âIâve time to lose and power to choose;
   âT is not so much the gallant who woos,
      But the gallantâs _way_ of wooing!â

   A lover came riding by awhile,
   A wealthy lover was he, whose smile
      Some maids would value greatlyâ
   A formal lover, who bowed and bent,
   With many a high-flown compliment,
      And cold demeanour stately,
   âYouâve still,â said she to her suitor stern,
   âThe âprentice-work of your craft to learn,
      If thus you come a-cooing.
   Iâve time to lose and power to choose;
   âT is not so much the gallant who woos,
      As the gallantâs _way_ of wooing!â

   A second lover came ambling byâ
   A timid lad with a frightened eye
      And a colour mantling highly.
   He muttered the errand on which heâd come,
   Then only chuckled and bit his thumb,
      And simpered, simpered shyly.
   âNo,â said the maiden, âgo your way;
   You dare but think what a man would say,
      Yet dare to come a-suing!
   Iâve time to lose and power to choose;
   âT is not so much the gallant who woos,
      As the gallantâs _way_ of wooing!â

   A third rode up at a startling paceâ
   A suitor poor, with a homely faceâ
      No doubts appeared to bind him.
   He kissed her lips and he pressed her waist,
   And off he rode with the maiden, placed
      On a pillion safe behind him.
   And she heard the suitor bold confide
   This golden hint to the priest who tied
      The knot thereâs no undoing;
   âWith pretty young maidens who can choose,
   âT is not so much the gallant who woos,
      As the gallantâs _way_ of wooing!â




HONGREE AND MAHRY.
A RECOLLECTION OF A SURREY MELODRAMA.


   THE sun was setting in its wonted west,
   When HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   Met MAHRY DAUBIGNY, the Village Rose,
   Under the Wizardâs Oakâold trysting-place
   Of those who loved in rosy Aquitaine.

   They thought themselves unwatched, but they were not;
   For HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   Found in LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOOLES DUBOSC
   A rival, envious and unscrupulous,
   Who thought it not foul scorn to dodge his steps,
   And listen, unperceived, to all that passed
   Between the simple little Village Rose
   And HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores.

   A clumsy barrack-bully was DUBOSC,
   Quite unfamiliar with the well-bred tact
   That animates a proper gentleman
   In dealing with a girl of humble rank.
   Youâll understand his coarseness when I say
   He would have married MAHRY DAUBIGNY,
   And dragged the unsophisticated girl
   Into the whirl of fashionable life,
   For which her singularly rustic ways,
   Her breeding (moral, but extremely rude),
   Her language (chaste, but ungrammatical),
   Would absolutely have unfitted her.
   How different to this unreflecting boor
   Was HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores.

   Contemporary with the incident
   Related in our opening paragraph,
   Was that sad war âtwixt Gallia and ourselves
   That followed on the treaty signed at Troyes;
   And so LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOOLES DUBOSC
   (Brave soldier, he, with all his faults of style)
   And HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   Were sent by CHARLES of France against the lines
   Of our Sixth HENRY (Fourteen twenty-nine),
   To drive his legions out of Aquitaine.

   When HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   Returned, suspecting nothing, to his camp,
   After his meeting with the Village Rose,
   He found inside his barrack letter-box
   A note from the commanding officer,
   Requiring his attendance at head-quarters.
   He went, and found LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOOLES.

   âYoung HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   This night we shall attack the English camp:
   Be the âforlorn hopeâ yoursâyouâll lead it, sir,
   And lead it too with credit, Iâve no doubt.
   As every man must certainly be killed
   (For you are twenty âgainst two thousand men),
   It is not likely that you will return.
   But what of that? youâll have the benefit
   Of knowing that you die a soldierâs death.â

   Obedience was young HONGREEâS strongest point,
   But he imagined that he only owed
   Allegiance to his MAHRY and his King.
   âIf MAHRY bade me lead these fated men,
   Iâd lead themâbut I do not think she would.
   If CHARLES, my King, said, âGo, my son, and die,â
   Iâd go, of courseâmy duty would be clear.
   But MAHRY is in bed asleep, I hope,
   And CHARLES, my King, a hundred leagues from this.
   As for LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOOLES DUBOSC,
   How know I that our monarch would approve
   The order he has given me to-night?
   My King Iâve sworn in all things to obeyâ
   Iâll only take my orders from my King!â
   Thus HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   Interpreted the terms of his commission.

   And HONGREE, who was wise as he was good,
   Disguised himself that night in ample cloak,
   Round flapping hat, and vizor mask of black,
   And made, unnoticed, for the English camp.
   He passed the unsuspecting sentinels
   (Who little thought a man in this disguise
   Could be a proper object of suspicion),
   And ere the curfew bell had boomed âlights out,â
   He found in audience Bedfordâs haughty Duke.

   âYour Grace,â he said, âstart notâbe not alarmed,
   Although a Frenchman stands before your eyes.
   Iâm HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores.
   My Colonel will attack your camp to-night,
   And orders me to lead the hope forlorn.
   Now I am sure our excellent KING CHARLES
   Would not approve of this; but heâs away
   A hundred leagues, and rather more than that.
   So, utterly devoted to my King,
   Blinded by my attachment to the throne,
   And having but its interest at heart,
   I feel it is my duty to disclose
   All schemes that emanate from COLONEL JOOLES,
   If I believe that they are not the kind
   Of schemes that our good monarch would approve.â

   âBut how,â said Bedfordâs Duke, âdo you propose
   That we should overthrow your Colonelâs scheme?â
   And HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores,
   Replied at once with never-failing tact:
   âOh, sir, I know this cursed country well.
   Entrust yourself and all your host to me;
   Iâll lead you safely by a secret path
   Into the heart of COLONEL JOOLESâ array,
   And you can then attack them unprepared,
   And slay my fellow-countrymen unarmed.â

   The thing was done.  The DUKE OF BEDFORD gave
   The order, and two thousand fighting men
   Crept silently into the Gallic camp,
   And slew the Frenchmen as they lay asleep;
   And Bedfordâs haughty Duke slew COLONEL JOOLES,
   And gave fair MAHRY, pride of Aquitaine,
   To HONGREE, Sub-Lieutenant of Chassoores.




ETIQUETTE. {243}


   THE _Ballyshannon_ foundered off the coast of Cariboo,
   And down in fathoms many went the captain and the crew;
   Down went the ownersâgreedy men whom hope of gain allured:
   Oh, dry the starting tear, for they were heavily insured.

   Besides the captain and the mate, the owners and the crew,
   The passengers were also drowned excepting only two:
   Young PETER GRAY, who tasted teas for BAKER, CROOP, AND CO.,
   And SOMERS, who from Eastern shores imported indigo.

   These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a mast,
   Upon a desert island were eventually cast.
   They hunted for their meals, as ALEXANDER SELKIRK used,
   But they couldnât chat togetherâthey had not been introduced.

   For PETER GRAY, and SOMERS too, though certainly in trade,
   Were properly particular about the friends they made;
   And somehow thus they settled it without a word of mouthâ
   That GRAY should take the northern half, while SOMERS took the south.

   On PETERâS portion oysters grewâa delicacy rare,
   But oysters were a delicacy PETER couldnât bear.
   On SOMERSâ side was turtle, on the shingle lying thick,
   Which SOMERS couldnât eat, because it always made him sick.

   GRAY gnashed his teeth with envy as he saw a mighty store
   Of turtle unmolested on his fellow-creatureâs shore.
   The oysters at his feet aside impatiently he shoved,
   For turtle and his mother were the only things he loved.

   And SOMERS sighed in sorrow as he settled in the south,
   For the thought of PETERâS oysters brought the water to his mouth.
   He longed to lay him down upon the shelly bed, and stuff:
   He had often eaten oysters, but had never had enough.

   How they wished an introduction to each other they had had
   When on board the _Ballyshannon_!  And it drove them nearly mad
   To think how very friendly with each other they might get,
   If it wasnât for the arbitrary rule of etiquette!

   One day, when out a-hunting for the _mus ridiculus_,
   GRAY overheard his fellow-man soliloquizing thus:
   âI wonder how the playmates of my youth are getting on,
   MâCONNELL, S. B. WALTERS, PADDY BYLES, and ROBINSON?â

   These simple words made PETER as delighted as could be,
   Old chummies at the Charterhouse were ROBINSON and he!
   He walked straight up to SOMERS, then he turned extremely red,
   Hesitated, hummed and hawed a bit, then cleared his throat, and said:

   âI beg your pardonâpray forgive me if I seem too bold,
   But you have breathed a name I knew familiarly of old.
   You spoke aloud of ROBINSONâI happened to be by.
   You know him?â  âYes, extremely well.â  âAllow me, so do I.â

   It was enough: they felt they could more pleasantly get on,
   For (ah, the magic of the fact!) they each knew ROBINSON!
   And Mr. SOMERSâ turtle was at PETERâS service quite,
   And Mr. SOMERS punished PETERâS oyster-beds all night.

   They soon became like brothers from community of wrongs:
   They wrote each other little odes and sang each other songs;
   They told each other anecdotes disparaging their wives;
   On several occasions, too, they saved each otherâs lives.

   They felt quite melancholy when they parted for the night,
   And got up in the morning soon as ever it was light;
   Each otherâs pleasant company they reckoned so upon,
   And all because it happened that they both knew ROBINSON!

   They lived for many years on that inhospitable shore,
   And day by day they learned to love each other more and more.
   At last, to their astonishment, on getting up one day,
   They saw a frigate anchored in the offing of the bay.

   To PETER an idea occurred.  âSuppose we cross the main?
   So good an opportunity may not be found again.â
   And SOMERS thought a minute, then ejaculated, âDone!
   I wonder how my business in the Cityâs getting on?â

   âBut stay,â said Mr. PETER: âwhen in England, as you know,
   I earned a living tasting teas for BAKER, CROOP, AND CO.,
   I may be supersededâmy employers think me dead!â
   âThen come with me,â said SOMERS, âand taste indigo instead.â

   But all their plans were scattered in a moment when they found
   The vessel was a convict ship from Portland, outward bound;
   When a boat came off to fetch them, though they felt it very kind,
   To go on board they firmly but respectfully declined.

   As both the happy settlers roared with laughter at the joke,
   They recognized a gentlemanly fellow pulling stroke:
   âTwas ROBINSONâa convict, in an unbecoming frock!
   Condemned to seven years for misappropriating stock!!!

   They laughed no more, for SOMERS thought he had been rather rash
   In knowing one whose friend had misappropriated cash;
   And PETER thought a foolish tack he must have gone upon
   In making the acquaintance of a friend of ROBINSON.

   At first they didnât quarrel very openly, Iâve heard;
   They nodded when they met, and now and then exchanged a word:
   The word grew rare, and rarer still the nodding of the head,
   And when they meet each other now, they cut each other dead.

   To allocate the island they agreed by word of mouth,
   And PETER takes the north again, and SOMERS takes the south;
   And PETER has the oysters, which he hates, in layers thick,
   And SOMERS has the turtleâturtle always makes him sick.




AT A PANTOMIME.
BY A BILIOUS ONE.


   AN Actor sits in doubtful gloom,
      His stock-in-trade unfurled,
   In a damp funereal dressing-room
      In the Theatre Royal, World.

   He comes to town at Christmas-time,
      And braves its icy breath,
   To play in that favourite pantomime,
      _Harlequin Life and Death_.

   A hoary flowing wig his weird
      Unearthly cranium caps,
   He hangs a long benevolent beard
      On a pair of empty chaps.

   To smooth his ghastly features down
      The actorâs art he cribs,â
   A long and a flowing padded gown.
      Bedecks his rattling ribs.

   He cries, âGo onâbegin, begin!
      Turn on the light of limeâ
   Iâm dressed for jolly Old Christmas, in
      A favourite pantomime!â

   The curtainâs upâthe stage all blackâ
      Time and the year nigh spedâ
   Time as an advertising quackâ
      The Old Year nearly dead.

   The wand of Time is waved, and lo!
      Revealed Old Christmas stands,
   And little children chuckle and crow,
      And laugh and clap their hands.

   The cruel old scoundrel brightens up
      At the death of the Olden Year,
   And he waves a gorgeous golden cup,
      And bids the world good cheer.

   The little ones hail the festive King,â
      No thought can make them sad.
   Their laughter comes with a sounding ring,
      They clap and crow like mad!

   They only see in the humbug old
      A holiday every year,
   And handsome gifts, and joys untold,
      And unaccustomed cheer.

   The old ones, palsied, blear, and hoar,
      Their breasts in anguish beatâ
   Theyâve seen him seventy times before,
      How well they know the cheat!

   Theyâve seen that ghastly pantomime,
      Theyâve felt its blighting breath,
   They know that rollicking Christmas-time
      Meant Cold and Want and Death,â

   StarvationâPoor Law Union fareâ
      And deadly cramps and chills,
   And illnessâillness everywhere,
      And crime, and Christmas bills.

   They know Old Christmas well, I ween,
      Those men of ripened age;
   Theyâve often, often, often seen
      That Actor off the stage!

   They see in his gay rotundity
      A clumsy stuffed-out dressâ
   They see in the cup he waves on high
      A tinselled emptiness.

   Those aged men so lean and wan,
      Theyâve seen it all before,
   They know theyâll see the charlatan
      But twice or three times more.

   And so they bear with dance and song,
      And crimson foil and green,
   They wearily sit, and grimly long
      For the Transformation Scene.




HAUNTED.


   HAUNTED?  Ay, in a social way
   By a body of ghosts in dread array;
   But no conventional spectres theyâ
      Appalling, grim, and tricky:
   I quail at mine as Iâd never quail
   At a fine traditional spectre pale,
   With a turnip head and a ghostly wail,
      And a splash of blood on the dickey!

   Mine are horrible, social ghosts,â
   Speeches and women and guests and hosts,
   Weddings and morning calls and toasts,
      In every bad variety:
   Ghosts who hover about the grave
   Of all thatâs manly, free, and brave:
   Youâll find their names on the architrave
      Of that charnel-house, Society.

   Black Mondayâblack as its school-room inkâ
   With its dismal boys that snivel and think
   Of its nauseous messes to eat and drink,
      And its frozen tank to wash in.
   That was the first that brought me grief,
   And made me weep, till I sought relief
   In an emblematical handkerchief,
      To choke such baby bosh in.

   First and worst in the grim arrayâ
   Ghosts of ghosts that have gone their way,
   Which I wouldnât revive for a single day
      For all the wealth of PLUTUSâ
   Are the horrible ghosts that school-days scared:
   If the classical ghost that BRUTUS dared
   Was the ghost of his âCÃ¦sarâ unprepared,
      Iâm sure I pity BRUTUS.

   I pass to critical seventeen;
   The ghost of that terrible wedding scene,
   When an elderly Colonel stole my Queen,
      And woke my dream of heaven.
   No schoolgirl decked in her nurse-room curls
   Was my gushing innocent Queen of Pearls;
   If she wasnât a girl of a thousand girls,
      She was one of forty-seven!

   I see the ghost of my first cigar,
   Of the thence-arising family jarâ
   Of my maiden brief (I was at the Bar,
      And I called the Judge âYour wushup!â)
   Of reckless days and reckless nights,
   With wrenched-off knockers, extinguished lights,
   Unholy songs and tipsy fights,
      Which I strove in vain to hush up.

   Ghosts of fraudulent joint-stock banks,
   Ghosts of âcopy, declined with thanks,â
   Of novels returned in endless ranks,
      And thousands more, I suffer.
   The only line to fitly grace
   My humble tomb, when Iâve run my race,
   Is, âReader, this is the resting-place
      Of an unsuccessful duffer.â

   Iâve fought them all, these ghosts of mine,
   But the weapons Iâve used are sighs and brine,
   And now that Iâm nearly forty-nine,
      Old age is my chiefest bogy;
   For my hair is thinning away at the crown,
   And the silver fights with the worn-out brown;
   And a general verdict sets me down
      As an irreclaimable fogy.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
