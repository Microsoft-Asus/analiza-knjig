Many there are who respond to the commonplace, monotonous call of
Duty, and year after year uncomplainingly spend their lives on the
treadmill of Routine; but who still feel in their hearts the call of
the open road, the music of the stars, the wine of the western wind,
and the thrilling abandon of a mad gallop out beyond speed limits and
grass signs to where life has ceased to be a series of cogs andâa man
is still a man.

To the members of this fraternity, whose emblem, hidden behind deep
and steadfast eyes, is often missed by man, but always recognized by
dogs and horses, I dedicate this book, in the hope that for an hour or
two it may lift the pressure a little.

JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME

Reviews are not infrequently colored by a temporary elevation of the
criticâs mind (or a temporary depression of the criticâs liver),
advertisements are not invariably free from bias; so, perhaps, a few
words of friendly warning will not be considered impertinent.

Whosoever is squeamishly sensitive as to the formal technique of
literary construction will save himself positive irritation by
avoiding this book. It is a told, rather than a written story; and
this is a compromise which defies Art and frankly turns to the more
elastic methods of Nature.

It is supposed to be told by an outdoor man in those delightful
moments of relaxation when the restraint of self-consciousness is
dropped, and the spirit flows forth with a freedom difficult to find,
outside the egoism of childhood. This general suggestion is easily
tossed out; but the reader must supply the detailsâthe night camps
with the pipes sending up incense about the tiny fires, the winter
evenings when the still cold lurks at the threshold or the blizzard
howls around the log corners; or those still more elusive moments when
the riding man shifts his weight to a single thigh, and tells the
inner story which has been rising from his open heart to his closed
lips for many a long mile.

Nor will these details suffice to complete the atmosphere in which,
bit by bit, the story is told. The greatest charm in the told story
comes direct from the teller; and, toil as we will over printed pages,
they obstinately refuse to reproduce the twinkle of bright, deep-set
eyes, the whimsical twist which gives character to a commonplace word,
the subtile modulations of a mellow voice, the discriminating accent
which makes a sentence fire when spoken, and only ashes when written;
or, hardest of all, those eloquent pauses and illuminating gestures
which convey a climax neither tongue nor pen dare attempt.

Happy Hawkins is complex, but the basic foundation of his character is
simplicity. His audience is usually a mixed one, men of the range and
an Easterner or two, fortunate enough to find the way into his
confidence. Occasionally he amuses himself by talking to the one group
over the heads of the other; but even then, his own simplicity is but
thinly veiled. The phases of life which he holds lightly are exploited
with riotous recklessness; but whoever would visit his private shrines
must tread with reverent step.

His exaggerations are not to deceive, but to magnifyâan adjunct to
expression invariably found among primitive people. A brass monkey is
really not sensitive to variations of temperature; and yet, even among
the civilized, a peculiarly vivid impression is conveyed by stating
that a particular cold snap has had a disintegrating effect upon the
integrity of a brass monkey. There is a philosophy of exaggeration
which is no kin to falsehood.

Happy has an eager, hungry, active mind, a mind worthy of careful
cultivation; but forced by circumstances to gather its nourishment
along lines similar to those adopted by the meek and lowly sponge. A
sponge is earnest, patient, and industrious; but, fixed to a submerged
stone as it is, it is hampered by limitations which no amount of
personal ambition is quite able to overcome. As Happy himself was fond
of saying: âThe thing âat sets most strangers again each other, is the
fact that each insists on judginâ everything from his own standpoint.
A cow-puncher gets the idee that because an Eastener canât sit
comfortable on a bronco when itâs sunfishinâ or twistinâ ends, he jes
nachely ainât fit to clutter up the surface oâ the earth; while the
Eastener is inclined to estimate the puncher anâ his pony as beinâ on
the same intellectual level. If theyâd just open up anâ examine each
other impartial, theyâd mighty soon see âat the difference in âem came
from what they did, instead oâ the choice oâ their lines oâ business
dependinâ on their natural make-up. I once had a no-account pinto
which refused to squat back on the rope, and I rejoiced exceeding when
I got seventy-five bucks for him; but the feller I took advantage of
clipped his mane, docked his tail, introduced him into swell-society,
and got three hundred for him as a polo pony; which all goes to
showââ (The finish of this is an expansive wave of the hand, a tilt
of the head to the right, and an indescribably droll expression.)

The above is a fair sample of the leisurely way in which Happy Hawkins
tells a story. This is not the proper way to tell a story. A story
should travel an air-line and not stop at the smaller stations, while
Happy prefers to take his bed along on a spare horse and camp out
wherever the mood strikes him. The reader who delights in a story
which speeds along like a limited, will probably be disappointed in
this book; while, on the other hand, the reader who enjoys the
intimate association which is lighted with the evening camp fire, runs
a risk of finding some relaxation in taking another little trip with
Happy Hawkins.

CHAPTER ONE

THE MEETING


Itâs a curious thingâlife. Ya might just as well ask a kitten to
chase her own tail or a dog to bay at the eveninâ star, or a
periodical spring to run constant, as to ask a feller right out to
tell a story. Some things can only be done spontaneous.

Friar Tuck used to say âat whenever he could cut it, he allus got on
the lee side oâ human nature and let it blow down on him natural; and
my way oâ gettinâ to the lee side oâ human nature in story-tellinâ is
not to ask for a story, but to start tellinâ one myself. And itâs a
good plan not to put over too good a one either; âcause if it seems as
though a feller is short run on stories, some listener is likely to
take pity on him and fit him out with a new assortment so as he wonât
be such bad company for himself when heâs alone again. This is the way
Iâve picked up most oâ my stories.

Then again, itâs allus hard for me to tell what is the true beginninâ
of a story. Itâs easy enough to tell cream from milkâafter the milk
has stood long enough for the cream to rise to the top; but the great
trouble is, that a manâs own recollections havenât stood long enough
for him to skim out just what part he might be in need of.

Without meaninâ the least mite oâ disrespect to any one, it does seem
to me that if I was able to plan out any sort of a memory at all, I
could have made a few improvements on the ones we now have.

My own memory is as stubborn as a mule and as grippy as a bulldog.
What it does remember, it calls up in the shape oâ pictures; and I see
old things just as plain as livinâ, breathinâ beings; but try as I
would, I never could keep my memory from loadinâ herself down with so
many trifles that sometimes Iâve had to spade it over as many as six
times to turn up some important item which I was actually in need of.
When my memoryâs in a good humor, I like to start a pipe and lean back
and just watch old scenes over again, the same as if I was in a
the-ater; and I can see every twinkle in a pair oâ well-known eyes,
which have been lookinâ up through six feet of earth for this many a
long year, and I can hearâactually hearâthe half tones ripplinâ
through voices which have no more part in my to-day than the perfume
oâ last yearâs flowers; and then, like as not, my memoryâll lay her
ears back and refuse to confide what I did with my shavinâ soap.

When I look back at my own life and compare it with others, it seems
like a curious, patch-worky sort of affair, and not much more my own
than the lives oâ those others with which I compare it. I allus liked
my work, and yet it never attracted my attention much. Side-trips and
such-like stand out plain as figures in a hand-painted picture, such
as Iâve seen in hotels down at Frisco; but the work part is just a
blotchy, colorless sort of smudge, the same as the background oâ one
oâ these pictures.

When I first took on with Jabezâevery one called him olâ Cast Steel
Judson at this timeâthey wanted to know if I could ride. I was
nothinâ but a regular kid then, so I handed in a purty high average as
to my ridinâ ability; though, truth to tell, I wasnât no bronco buster
those days. They gave me a genuwine mean one as a starter, and told me
to ride him clean or step off and walk.

At that time I didnât even know how to discard a hoss when I couldnât
stand the poundinâ any longer; so when I felt my backbone gettinâ
wedged too far into my skull, I made a grab for the horn. My luck was
on the job that day and I got the quirt, instead. At his next pitch,
my hand went up as natural as ever, and I slammed down the quirt as
hard as I could. It landed on a ticklish spot and before he had time
to make up his mind, the cayuse had started to run, me whalinâ him at
every jump and givinâ thanks between âem. I rode him good and out as
soon as he started to stampede, and they all thought I was a real
rider. Well, this gave me a lot oâ troubleâtryinâ to live up to my
reputationâbut thatâs a good sort oâ trouble for a kid to have.

Now I can feel all the sensations oâ this ride as plain as though it
was this morninâ; but theâs a thousand rides since then which have all
melted anâ run together. The same with most oâ the rest oâ my work: I
allus aimed to do my bit a little quicker and cleaner ân the rest; but
as soon as I learned all the tricks of it, it fell into a rut, like
breathinâ and seeinâ. Easteners seem to have an idee that our life
must be as carefree and joyous as goinâ to a different circus every
day in the year; but it ainât: itâs work, just like all other work.
Weâre a good bit like our ridinâ ponies: when weâre in the thick of it
weâre too busy to take notice; and when weâre through, weâre
hungryâand thatâs about the whole story.

Jabez Judson was a high peak, and once a feller knew him, he never ran
any risk oâ gettinâ him mixed up with any one else. He was the settest
in his ways of any man I ever had much doinâs with; but he didnât
change about anyâif he faced north on a question one day, he faced
north on it always; so a feller could tell just how any action would
strike him, and this made livinâ with him as accurate as workinâ out a
problem in multiplication, which I claim to hold qualities oâ comfort.

His daughter, Barbie, was a little tot when I first took on; and she
was the apple of olâ Cast Steelâs eye; anâ his curb bit, and his spurs
as well. Barbie and I were pals from one end oâ the trail to the
other, and this explains a lot oâ my life which otherwise wouldnât
have any answer. My ordinary work at the Diamond Dot wasnât
out-standinâ enough to give me any special privileges; but I happened
to come back one time when the Brophy gang was about to clean things
out, and Jabez gave me credit for savinâ Barbieâs life; so âat he
didnât check up my time any and I did purty much as I pleased, only
quittinâ him when I couldnât put up with his set ways any longer. I
aimed to play fair with Jabez, and he with me; but once in a while we
locked horns, though not often, takinâ everything into account.

It was shortly after olâ Cast Steel had bought in the D lazy L brand,
anâ we was still pickinâ up strays here anâ there. Whenever he bought
up a brand he allus put the Diamond Dot on the stuff as soon as he
could, his mark commandinâ more respect than some oâ the little
fellersâ.

When Iâd get tired oâ loafing about the home place, Iâd take one oâ
the boys anâ weâd start out to look for stray hosses. Spider Kelley
was with me this time, anâ we had meandered here anâ there until we
had picked up a big enough string to stand as an excuse for our trip,
and were about minded to start back.

We had just forded a little crick when we heard a manâs voice singinâ
off to the right. Theâ was a mess oâ cottonwoods between us, anâ we
stopped to listen. Now I had never heard that voice before, anâ I had
never seen the man who was running it; but right then I was ready to
believe anything he had a mind to tell me. It was a deep, rich voice;
but mellow anâ tender, anâ a feller could tell that he was singinâ
simply because he couldnât help it.

Spider looked at me with his face shininâ, anâ I could feel a sort oâ
pleasant heat in my own face. Theâ was a lift anâ a swing, and a sort
of rally-around-the-flag to this voice which got right into ya, anâ
made you want to do something.

    ââT is thine to save from perils of perdition
      The souls for whom the Lord His life laid down;
    Beware, lest, slothful to fulfill thy mission,
      Thou lose one jewel that should deck His crown.
        Publish glad tidings; tidings of peace;
        Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.â

âThat feller can sing some,â sez Spider Kelley; but just then the
ponies turned back on us anâ by the time we had started âem on again,
the singer had passed on up the trail, so I didnât make any reply.

I was tryinâ to figure out whether it was the words or the tune or the
voice, or what it was that had made my whole body vibrate like a
fiddle string. As I said before, I see things in pictures anâ I also
remember âem in pictures: a sound generally calls up a picture to me
anâ it ainât allus a picture anyways connected with the sound itself.
This song, for instance, had called to my mind a long procession of
marchinâ men with banners wavinâ anâ set faces, shininâ with a glad
sort oâ recklessness. There ainât no accountinâ for the human mind: I
had never seen such a procession in real life, nor even in a picture;
but that was what this song out there on the open range suggested to
me, anâ I hurried out oâ the cottonwoods eager to measure the singer
with my open eyes.

When we climbed up out of the woods, we saw him goinâ up the pass
ahead of us with our ponies followinâ behind as though they was part
of his outfit. We could just catch glimpses of him; enough to show
that he was a big man on a big roan hoss, anâ that he was a ridinâ man
in spite oâ the fact that he was wearinâ black clothes made up Eastern
style. He was still singinâ his song, anâ I straightened up in my
saddle, anâ beat time with my hand as though I held a genuwine sword
in it; which is a tool Iâve never had much doinâs with.

We scrambled on up the trail, anâ when we reached the top we found a
little park with the grass knee high anâ a fringe oâ spruce trees
about it. The song had come to a sudden end, anâ we found the singer
on foot with a noose about his neck anâ nine rather tough-lookinâ
citizens holdinâ a parley with him. We came to the same sort of a stop
the song had, anâ Spider Kelley sez in a low tone, âWhat do ya suppose
this is?â

âI donât know,â sez I, touchinâ my pony, âbut Iâm with the singerâ; so
me anâ Spider rode on down to âem.

I purty well sensed what it was: theâ was a heap oâ rebrandinâ beinâ
done at that time, anâ stringinâ a man up was supposed to be the only
cure; but I was willinâ to bet my roll that this singer wasnât a
rustler. The feller in charge oâ the posse was an evil-lookinâ cuss,
anâ if heâd âaâ had the rope around his neck, it wouldnât have looked
so misplaced. He was ridinâ a Cross brand hoss; so I guessed him to
belong to the Tyrrel Jones outfit. Most oâ the others in the posse was
ridinâ the same brand oâ hosses anâ wearinâ the same brand of
expressions. It was a tough-lookinâ bunch.

We came up to âem anâ they looked our ponies anâ us over anâ nodded.
We nodded back anâ I asked âem what seemed to be the trouble.

âWeâve finally got the feller who has been doinâ the rustlinâ out this
way,â sez the leader, whose name was Flannigan, Badger-face Flannigan.

âThatâs good,â sez I; âbut he donât look the part.â

âHe acts it all right,â growls Badger-face, showinâ his fangs in what
was meant for a grin. âHeâs ridinâ one of our hosses, anâ leadinâ a
string oâ D lazy Ls.â

âLeadinâ âem?â sez I.

âYes, heâs got some sort of a charm in his voice. Whiskers, here, saw
him go up on foot anâ rope this colt anâ lead him off the same as a
plow hoss.â

âDid Whiskers, here, see him charm the loose string, too?â I asked.

âNo, he came in anâ collected the posse, anâ we decided that this
would be a good place to try him; so we cut up the other pass anâ
waited for him. When he came up, this bunch oâ ponies was tagginâ
after him.â

I looked at the man with the noose about his neck, anâ he was grinninâ
as easy anâ comfortable as I ever saw a man grin in my life. He was
wearinâ a vest without buttons anâ a gray flannel shirt. He had a
rifle on his saddle anâ a sixshooter on his right hip. He had big gray
eyes set wide apart under heavy brows, anâ they were dancinâ with
laughter. I grinned into âem without intendinâ to, anâ sez: âWell, I
donât really think he charmed these loose ponies intentional. Me anâ
Spider was takinâ âem in to the Diamond Dot anâ we had a hard time
makinâ âem ford the crick. Iâm some thankful to him for tollinâ âem up
the pass.â

Badger-face scowled. âWell, anyhow, he charmed the beast heâs ridin,
all right; anâ he has to swing for it.â

âAre you all done with tryinâ him,â sez I.

âWhatâs the use of a trial?â snarled Badger-face. âAinât he ridinâ a
Cross brand hoss, ainât the brand unvented, donât every one know that
we never sell a hoss without ventinâ the brand, anâ canât any one see
âat this hoss was never rode before?â

âGot anything to say for yourself, stranger?â I asked.

âNot much,â sez the prisoner. âI have an appointment to keep at
Laramie; my hoss gave out; so I just caught a fresh one anâ started
on.â

âWhat more do you want?â asked Badger-face of me.

âWell, now, theâ ainât any particular hurry; anâ Iâm kind oâ curious
to learn a little more of his methods,â sez I impartial. âDonât ya
know âat this is what they call hoss-stealinâ out this way?â I asked
of the stranger.

âNo, this is not stealinâ,â he replied. âI turned another hoss loose
that I had picked up a hundred miles or so farther back; and I should
have turned this one adrift as soon as he had tired. They allus wander
back to their own range.â

This wasnât no unheard-of custom to practice out our way; but it was a
new sort oâ defence for a man with a noose about his neck to put up,
anâ I see that some oâ the others was gettinâ interested. The big man
had a smile like a boy, anâ steady eyes, anâ a clear skin; anâ he
didnât look at all the kind of a man to really need stretchinâ.

âWhatâs your plan for earninâ a livinâ?â I asked.

âI am a kind of apostle,â sez he, âanâ I live on the bounty of
others.â

âDo you mean âat youâre a preacher?â asked Badger-face.

âYes,â the stranger replied with a smile.

[Illustration: We found the singer on foot with a noose about his neck
anâ nine rather tough-lookinâ citizens holdinâ a parley with him]

âWell, I never see a preacher with as short hair as yours, nor one who
carried so much artillery, nor one who made a practice oâ pickinâ up a
fresh hoss whenever he felt like it. Whereâd you learn to ride, anâ
whereâd you learn to rope?â

âEastern Colorado. I lived there four years, anâ travelled on
hossback,â sez the stranger.

âIâll bet you left there mighty sudden,â sez Badger-face with an evil
leer.

âYes,â replied the stranger, with a grin, âanâ I also left on
hossback.â

âWell, ya satisfied now?â grunted Badger-face to me.

Livinâ out doors the way I had, I naturally had a big respect for
brands. Itâs mighty comfortinâ to feel that ya can turn your stuff
loose anâ know that itâs not likely to be bothered; so I was up
something of a stump about this new doctrine. âWhereâd you get your
commission from to pick up a hoss whenever you feel like it?â sez I to
the stranger.

He had a little leather sack hanginâ from his saddle horn, anâ he
reached into it anâ fished out a small book with a soft leather cover.
The feller âat was holdinâ his hoss eyed him mighty close for fear it
was some sort of a gun; but the stranger ran over the leaves with his
fingers as ready as a man would step into the home corral anâ rope his
favorite ridinâ pony.

âHereâs my commission,â sez he, as self-satisfied as though he was
holdinâ a government document; anâ then he read aloud with that deep,
mellow voice oâ his, the story of the time the Lord was minded to let
himself out a little anâ came into Jerusalem in state. He read it all,
anâ then he paused, looked about, holdinâ each manâs eyes with his own
for a second, anâ then he read once more the part where the Lord had
sent in a couple of his hands after the colt that no man had ever
backed beforeâanâ then he closed the book, patted it gentle anâ
shoved it back into the leather bag. I looked around on the posse, anâ
most of âem was rubbinâ their chins, anâ studyinâ. Iâve noticed that
while the earth is purty well cluttered up with pale-blooded anâ
partially ossified Christians, theâs mighty few out anâ out atheists
among âem.

âThat donât go,â sez Badger-face, after heâd taken time to pump up his
nerve a little.

No one said anything for a space, anâ then the stranger put a little
edge on his voice, but spoke in a lower tone than before: âThat does
go,â he said. âNo matter what else in life may be questioned, no
matter how hard and fast a title may stick, it must crumble to dust
when one comes and says, âThe Lord hath need of this.â It may be your
life or it may be your property or it may be the one being you love
most in all the world; but when the Lord hath need, your own needs
must fall away.

âNow, boys, I love the West, I glory in the fact that I can lay
something down and go on about my business anâ come back a month later
and find it just where I left it; and if I was takinâ these hosses to
sell or trade or use for my own selfish ends, why, I wouldnât have a
word to say againâ your stringinâ me up. I brought my own hoss into
this country and when it gave out I didnât have time to barter anâ
trade for another one; so I just caught one, and when it grew weary, I
turned it adrift. I donât claim the hosses I ride; I donât want to own
them; I simply borrow them for a while because my Lord hath need of
them. I treat them well, and when they weary, send âem back to their
own range with a pat, and pick up another. The next fellow who rides
that hoss will find it a little less trouble than if I hadnât used it,
and thereâs no harm done at all. Iâm working with you, Iâm going to
make your own work easier out here by raisinâ the respect for brands,
not by makinâ property rights any looser; and you are goinâ to work
with meâwhether you want to or not. Now then, how much longer are you
goinâ to keep this fool noose about my neck?â

That posse wasnât easy minded, not by a jugful. This stranger was
speakinâ as though he had power anâ authority anâ public opinion all
on his side, and they felt considâable like the tenderfoot whoâd roped
the buffaloâthey was willinâ to quit any time he was.

The Cross brand boys were purty sullen anâ moody; but four oâ the
posse belonged to another outfit, anâ they couldnât stand the strain.
One of âem, a grizzled old codger with one lamp missinâ, lifted the
noose from the prisonerâs neck, anâ sez most respectful: âParson, Iâm
an old man. I ainât heard a sermon for forty years, anâ Iâd be right
obliged to ya if youâd make us one.â

Badger-face, he snorted scornful; but the rest of the posse was
scattered all the way from repentance to sheepishness, anâ the
stranger he stepped to a little rise anâ he certainly did speak us a
sermon. First off, he sang us St. Andrewâs hymnâI got to learn a good
many of his songs after this, but oâ course at that time I was as shy
on hymns as the rest oâ the crowd.

I tell you it was wonderful up in that little park, with the lush
grass for a carpet, the spruce trees for panelinâ, the bare peaks
stickinâ out for rafter-beams, the blue sky above for ceiling, and
that soft, deep voice fillinâ the whole place anâ yet stealinâ into a
fellerâs heart as easy anâ gentle as a womanâs whisper. He sort oâ
beat time as though playinâ on an instrument, until before he was
through we were all humminâ in time with himâanâ then he preached.

He told us about the fisher folks anâ how they lived out doors under
the stars the same as we did; and that this was probably why the Lord
had chose âem first to follow him. He said that city folks got to
relyinâ on themselves so much âat they was likely to forget that the
whole earth was still held in the hollow of the hand which had created
it; but that men who lived with nature, out under the sun and the
stars, through the heat and the cold, the wind and the rain, the
chinook and the blizzard, felt the forces and the mysteries all about
them and this kept âem in touch, even when they didnât know it
themselves, with the great central Intelligence back oâ these forces
and mysteries. Then he told âem how grand their lives might be if they
would only give up their nasty little habits of thought, and learn to
think broad and free and deep, the same as they breathed.

He told âem âat their minds could breathe the inspiration of God as
easy as their lungs could breathe the pure air oâ the mountains, if
theyâd only form the habit. Then he talked to âem friendly anâ
confidential about their natural devilment. He didnât talk like a
saint speakinâ out through a crack in the gates oâ Paradise, like most
preachers do. He called the turn on the actual way they cut up when
they went to town, and just how it hurt âem body anâ soul; and his
face grew set and earnest, and his eyes blazed; and then he said a few
words about mothers anâ children and such, and wound up with a short
prayer.

Well two oâ those fellers owned up right out in public and said that
from that on they was goinâ to lead a decent sort of life; and one
other said âat he didnât have any faith in himself any longer; but he
insisted on signinâ the pledge, and said if that worked, why, heâd go
on anâ try the rest of it.

The preacher shook hands with âem all aroundâhe had a grip âat
wouldnât be no disgrace for a silver-tipâanâ then he sez that if any
of âem has the notion that beinâ a Christian makes a weakling of a
man, why, heâs willinâ to wrastle or box or run a race or shoot at a
mark or do any other sort of a stunt to show âat heâs in good order;
but they size him up and take his word for it.

âNow, boys,â sez he, âI hope weâll meet often. Iâm your friend, and I
want you to use me any time you get a chance. Any time or any place
that I can serve one of you, just get me word and Iâll do the best I
can. It donât matter what sort oâ trouble you get into, get me word
and Iâll helpâif I can find a way. And I wish âat youâd speak it
around that Iâm hard on hosses, so that the other fellows will
understand when I pick one up, and not cause any delay. Iâll have to
hurry along now. Good-bye; Iâm sorry Iâve been a bother to ya.â

He swung up on the big roan, waved his hand and trotted out oâ the
park; and just as he went down the pass on the other side, it seemed
that he couldnât hold it in any longer; so he opened up his voice in
his marchinâ song again, anâ we all stayed silent as long as we could
hear the sound of it.

âWell we are a lot of soft marks!â sez Badger-face at last.

âThat there is a true man,â replied old Grizzly, shakinâ his head,
âanâ Iâll bet my boots on it.â

This seemed to be the general verdict, anâ the Cross brand fellers
went off discussinâ the parson, anâ me anâ Spider Kelley collected our
ponies anâ went along to the ranch, also discussinâ him.

That was the first time I ever saw Friar Tuck; I made up my mind about
him just from hearinâ his voice, anâ before I ever saw him; but I
never had to make it up any different. New lead anâ new steel look
considâable alike; but the more ya wear on lead, the sooner it wears
out, while the more you wear on steel, the brighter it gets. The Friar
was steel, anâ mighty well tempered.




CHAPTER TWO

THE BETTINâ BARBER Oâ BOGGS


Yes, this was about the time I got interested in the bettinâ barber
over at Boggs. He hasnât anything to do with this story Iâm about to
tell ya, except that it was him âat give the Friar his name; so Iâll
just skim through this part as hasty as possible. When a feller is
tellinâ me a story, I want him to stick to the trail of it; but it
seems like when I try to tell one, myself, some feller is allus askinâ
me a question âat takes me clear out oâ range.

All barbers are more or less different, except in what might be called
the gift oâ gab. This one came out to Boggs station, anâ started a
shop. His name was Eugene, anâ he was a little man with two rollinâ
curls to his front hair, which he wore short behind. A curious thing
about little men is, that they donât never find it out. A little man
produces more opinions ân airy other kind, anâ being small, they
havenât no place to store âem up until they get time to ripen. A
little man gives out his opinion anâ then looks savageâjust as if
heâd get a switch anâ make ya believe it, whether you wanted to or
not.

Eugene had come from every city theâ is in the world, anâ he used to
tell scandalous tales about the prominent people who lived in âem
whose hair he had cut. He was also familiar with the other things
which had happened since theyâve begun to write history, anâ if any
one would doubt one of his statements, heâd whirl about holding up his
razor, anâ say: âIâll bet ya a dollar I can prove it.â

All of us fellers used to go in as often as we got a chance to get our
chins shaved anâ our hair shampooedâjust to hear Eugene get indignant
about things which wasnât none of our business. We used to bet with
him a lot, just for the fun oâ makinâ him prove up things; which he
did by writinâ letters to somebody anâ gettinâ back the answers he
wanted. We didnât have any way to prove our side; so Eugene got the
money anâ we had the fun.

Olâ man Dort ran the general store and kept a pet squirrel in a
whirlabout cage, which was the biggest squirrel I ever see, anâ had
its tail gnawed off by a rat, or something, before Eugene came. Olâ
man Dort had a reputation for arguinâ, which spread all over our part
of the earth. We had made a habit oâ goinâ to him to get our
discussions settled anâ when we began to pass him up for Eugene, he
foamed about it free anâ frank.

He wore a prodigious tangle oâ hair and a bunch oâ grizzled whiskers,
about as fine anâ smooth as a clump oâ grease-wood. He used to brag
that razor nor scissors hadnât touched his hide for twenty years, anâ
one of us boys would allus add, âNor soap nor water, neither,â anâ olâ
man Dort would grin proud, âcause it was a point of honor with him.

Eugene used to send out for his wearinâ anâ sech, so olâ man Dort
didnât get a whack at him in his store; olâ man Dort batched, anâ
Eugene boarded, so they didnât clash up at their meals; anâ finally
olâ man Dort swore a big oath that he was goinâ to be barbered. The
news got out anâ the boys came in for forty miles to see the funâanâ
it was worth it.

We went early to the shop anâ planted ourselves, lookinâ solemn anâ
not sayinâ anything to put Eugene on his guard. When at last olâ man
Dort hove in sight with his brows scowled down anâ his jaws set under
his shrubbery, we all bit our lips; anâ Eugene stopped tellinâ us
about the hair-roots oâ the Prince of Wales, anâ stood lookinâ at olâ
man Dort with his mouth gapped wide open.

The olâ man came in, shut the door careful behind him, glared at
Eugene, as though darinâ him to do his worst, anâ said: âI want my
hair shamped, anâ my whiskers shaved off.â

âIf you expected to get it all done in one day, you should ought to
have come earlier,â sez Eugene soberly, but tossinâ us a side wink.

âWell, you do as much as you can to-day, anâ weâll finish up
to-morrow,â sez olâ man Dort, not seeinâ the joke.

Olâ man Dort peeled off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, anâ climbed
into the chair as if he thought it was liable to buck him off. Then he
settled back with a grunt, anâ Eugene tucked the bib in around his
neck, combed his fingers through olâ man Dortâs hair a minute, anâ
sez; âYour hairâs startinâ to come out. You should ought to use a
tonic.â

âTonic, hell!â snaps the olâ man. âMy hair sheds out twice a year,
same as the rest oâ the animals.â

âThen you should ought to comb it,â sez Eugene. âIâve got some hair
here in my hand which was shed out two years ago. Leavinâ dead hair
anâ such rubbish as that layinâ around on your scalp is what kills the
hair globules.â

âIt donât either; it acts like fertilizer, the same as dead grass
does,â sez olâ man Dort. He had made up his mind to take the contrary
side of everything âat Eugene said, anâ it was more fun than a dog
fight.

Eugene started in by mowinâ away the whiskers, anâ it was a long anâ
painful job; âcause it was almost impossible to tell where they left
off anâ olâ man Dort began, anâ then they was so cluttered up with
grit anâ dead hair and kindry deb-ris that his scissors would choke up
anâ pull, anâ then olâ man Dort would bob up his head anâ yell out a
bunch oâ profanity, and Eugene would stand back anâ say that he was a
barber, not a clearer of new ground, anâ that the job ought to be done
with a scythe and hoe, not with scissors anâ razor. Eugene wasnât
covetous of olâ man Dortâs trade anâ didnât care whether he insulted
him or not.

The most fun came, though, after Eugene had got down to where he could
tell the outline of olâ man Dortâs face. First he soaked it with
lather, combinâ it in with a comb, anâ puttinâ hot towels on it to
draw out the alkalie grit anâ give his razors some show.

One of olâ man Dortâs manias was, that a man ought to pay his debts,
whether it killed him or not; so as soon as Eugene had him steaminâ
under the towels we begun to talk about a manâs first duty beinâ
toward his kin, anâ that if he couldnât pay his debts without bother,
he ought to let the debts go anâ show his relatives a good time while
they was still on earth anâ able to enjoy themselves.

Olâ man Dort couldnât stand it, anâ tried to answer back from under
the towels; but got his mouth full oâ suds, anâ choked on the corner
of a towel until Eugene said that if he couldnât sit still anâ behave
himself he could go out to some alfalfa farmer to get his tonsoral
work completed.

It wasnât the olâ manâs faultâhe simply couldnât help it. Touch him
up on a ticklish subject, anâ he just had to come back at ya, same as
a rattler. Finally, however, Eugene had the stubble wore down anâ
softened until he decided that he stood a chance againâ it, anâ then
he lathered anâ rubbed, anâ lathered anâ rubbed, until nothinâ stuck
out below olâ man Dortâs eyes except the peak of his nose; anâ then us
boys pulled out our trump card anâ played it strong. We began to talk
about red squirrels.

Now, we didnât know anything professional about squirrels, except what
olâ man Dort had told us; but we slewed his talk around this way anâ
that as if it was our own private opinions; anâ the olâ man began to
groan audible. He gritted his teeth, though, anâ bore up under it like
a hero, until Eugene begin to chip in with what he knew about
squirrels.

Eugene was never content to just speak of a thing in a general
wayâhis main method of convincinâ us was to allus fall back on his
own personal experience; so this time he began to tell of squirrels
what he had been full acquainted with. He called âem by name anâ told
how they would run to meet him anâ climb up on his shoulders anâ
chatter for nuts, anâ so on; until the olâ manâs ears turned red with
the strain he was under. And then, we got to discussinâ the size oâ
squirrels.

We told about squirrels we had heard about, anâ contested againâ each
other to see which had heard oâ the biggest one; but we never even
mentioned olâ man Dortâs squirrel. Eugene had shaved his way down to
below the lobe of olâ man Dortâs right ear, slippinâ in a side remark
to our talk every minute or so; anâ purty soon he sez âat he knows a
squirrel by the name oâ Daniel Webster back in Montpelier, Vermont,
which was a full half inch longer ân airy red squirrel we had spoke
of. The olâ man couldnât stand this. His head bobbed up, cuttinâ a
gash on the crook of his jaw, and as soon as he could blow the foam
out of his mouth, he sez, âIâll stake my life, theâ ainât another
squirrel in this country as big as my own Ben Butler.â

Eugene put his hand on olâ man Dortâs forehead anâ pushed him back
into the headrest. âYou lie there,â sez he, âuntil I get done shavinâ
ya. Then, Iâll bet ya a dollar that I can produce a livinâ squirrel
whichâll out-stand, outweigh, anâ out-fight your squirrelâanâ I ainât
never seen your squirrel.â

âA dollar!â snorts the olâ man, flickinâ up his head. âI wouldnât
bother wakinâ Ben Butler up for a measly dollar. Iâll bet ya ten
dollars.â

âGet back on that headrest,â orders Eugene. âTen dollars looks a heap
sight better to me than one, anâ Iâll be mighty glad to accommodate
ya.â

Eugene took his fire-stick anâ burned the olâ manâs cut, anâ the olâ
man had to scruge up his shoulders with the pain of it; but he did it
without noticinâ, âcause his mind was on squirrels. âWhat breed oâ
squirrels is yours?â he asked.

âIf you donât keep your head where I put it, Iâll throw up the job anâ
let you go forth lookinâ like the lost Goog oâ Mayhan,â sez Eugene,
raisinâ his voice. Olâ man Dort was a whalinâ big man, anâ it tickled
us a heap to see little Eugene givinâ him directions, like as if he
was nothinâ but a pup dog.

Olâ man Dort settled back with a sigh, anâ Eugene leathered up his
razor without sayinâ anything for a minute or two. Then he sez, as he
begins shavinâ again: âThat squirrel I have in mind for ring contests
is the short-tailed grizzly ground-squirrel; and itâs the biggest
breed of squirrels theâ is.â

âTheâ ainât no such a breed of squirrel as that!â yells olâ man Dort,
springing erect in his chair, anâ dullinâ Eugeneâs razor by the
operation.

Eugene stepped back anâ looked at the blood flowinâ from the fresh
cut, anâ he sez slow anâ sarcastic; âIf it donât make any difference
to you whether you have any skin on your face or not, why Iâll just
peel it off anâ tack it on a board to shave it; but hanged if Iâm
goinâ to duck around tryinâ to shave you on the jump. Theâ is too
grizzly ground-squirrels.â

Well, thatâs the way they had it back and forth: every time they would
settle down to business anâ Eugene would get a square inch oâ the olâ
manâs face cleared up, one of us boys would speak something in a low
tone about there beinâ rumors of an uncommon big squirrel out at some
ranch house a hundred miles or so from there. Eugene would ask what
breed of squirrel it was, anâ then decide that it couldnât be a
patchinâ on a genuwine short-tailed grizzly ground-squirrel, anâ then
olâ man Dort couldnât stand it no longer anâ he would forget what he
was doinâ, bob up in his chair, anâ lose some more of his life fluid.

Eugene scraped down both sides oâ the olâ manâs face, givinâ all of
his razors a chance to take part in the job, anâ then he set his lips
anâ started in on the chin.

âWhat does short-tailed grizzly ground-squirrels eat, Eugene?â asked
Spider Kelley, as innocent as an infant pigeon.

âThey eat chickens,ââ began Eugene, but olâ man Dort flew clean out
oâ the chair anâ stood over Eugene shakinâ with rage.

âChickens?â he roars. âChickens! Theâ never was a squirrel foaled into
this world what et chickens.â

Eugene looked at olâ man Dort, anâ then he wiped his razor anâ sat
down on a chair, so full of disgust that he could hardly breathe.

âI wish youâd take off that apron anâ bleed into the spittoon,â he
said as calm as he could. âIâve got customers whose patronage is what
makes up my living expenses; anâ I donât want âem to come in here anâ
see the whole place a welter of gore.

âWhat do you think this shop is, anyway?â yelled Eugene springing to
his feet anâ entirely losinâ his patience. âDo you think that I make
my livinâ by grubbinâ down wire grass which has been let grow for
fifty years, anâ educatinâ ignoramuses in the knowledge of squirrels?
I donât care whether you believe in short-tailed grizzly
ground-squirrels or not; but if you donât let me tie your head down to
that chair, I wonât shave another sprout off your chin. I take some
pride in my profession, anâ I donât intend to have no man go out oâ my
shop leavinâ a trail oâ blood which will draw all the dogs for miles
around. Now, you can take your choice.â

Olâ man Dort had to give in that this was reasonable enough; so he
climbed back into the chair, anâ Eugene tied down his head anâ
finished him off without any more trouble. As soon as he had stopped
the bleedinâ anâ put on the perfume anâ oil anâ powder, he sez: âNow,
what I am goinâ to do is to get some nourishment to recuperate back my
strength, anâ if you want the waste products washed out oâ your hair,
you come back here at one oâclock prompt.â

âI want to settle on that bet first,â said olâ man Dort, who was just
as pernicious as Eugene, once you got him riled up.

âIâll make that bet with you after dinner,â sez Eugene, âbut first off
I got to have food; Iâm faint with weakness. Now, Iâm goinâ to lock up
my shop.â

After Eugene had marched off to his boardinâ house, we all gathered
around olâ man Dort, anâ complimented him on his improved appearance,
though to be strictly honest, theâ was considerable doubts about it.
He had two teeth out in front, anâ the tobacco habit; and now, with no
shrubbery to catch the spray, he spluttered terrible when he tried to
talk fast. He said, though, that as long as he had started in he
intended to take the full course, anâ was cominâ back, as soon as heâd
had a bite to eat, to get his hair laundried anâ trimmed up some
around the edges; anâ then he was goinâ to make that bet about the
squirrels.

It was some amusinâ to see the olâ man get his hair sluiced out, but
not near as much fun as seeinâ him shaved. Whenever Eugene found any
stray product, heâd call us all over anâ show it to us, anâ this riled
the olâ man up considerable; but the best joke was when Eugene found a
womanâs hairpin.

The olâ man vowed anâ declared anâ carried on somethinâ fierce; but
there was the hairpin, anâ we made him pay for three rounds on the
strength of it. As soon as Eugene was all through, the olâ man settled
the bill, payinâ for a full dayâs work like a regular sport, anâ not
tryinâ to beg off at the ordinary retail price; and then he hardened
his face anâ sez: âNow I bet you ten dollars, that you canât bring
forward a squirrel as big as my Ben Butler.â

âIâll take that bet,â sez Eugene, âbut you got to give me time to
locate a short-tailed grizzly. Itâs the scarcest breed theâ is, anâ
itâll probably cost me twice the sum to get one, but I donât care
about that. What I want is to vindicate myself. Iâd like to see that
squirrel oâ yours.â

âYou come right along,â sez olâ man Dort, glowinâ with pride. âI
reckon when you see him, youâll just hand over the money at onceâThat
is, if you know anything at all about squirrels.â

We all marched around to the general store, anâ olâ man Dort pounded
on the cage. When Ben Butler sat up anâ looked around to see what was
up, the olâ man waved his hand at him, looked down at Eugene, anâ sez:
âWell?â He said it just like that: âWu-el?â

Ben Butler was rollinâ fat, anâ he certainly did look like some
squirrel to us; but Eugene merely glanced at him, anâ sez: âHum, what
we call a dwarf red squirrel, up in Nova Scotia. They have tails,
though, up there.â

The olâ man spluttered till we had to pound him on the back. âDwarf?â
he chokes out. âDwarf! You produce a squirrel to match him, will ya,
or else you pack up your truck anâ move on. I donât intend to have
noââ

âSee here, olâ man,â sez Eugene, pointinâ a finger at him the same as
if heâd been a naughty child. âA short-tailed grizzly ground-squirrel
is from two to four times as big as this one, so if you want to
sidestep the bet, you can do it; but if you want to have some show for
your money, I bet you fifty to ten that I can get a squirrel three
times as big as this one. I own up that for its kind, this squirrel is
of fair, average growth; butââ

âIâll take that bet!â yelled the old man. âWeâll put up our money with
Ike Spargle this minute; but I donât want your odds. Iâll bet you even
money.â

Eugene shook his head as if he pitied the olâ man, anâ he sez,
âHavenât you never travelled none, or seen a zoological garden?â

âYes, Iâve travelled some, anâ Iâve seen all kinds oâ gardens,â flares
back the olâ man; âbut what I want now is to fix up this bet.â

âWhoâll be the judges?â sez Eugene.

âI donât care a snap. Any man who can see through the holes in a
ladderâll be able to decide between the claims oâ two squirrels. Ike
Spargle anâ Bill Thompson can be the judges.â

âThere has to be three,â sez Eugene. âWeâll have Dan Stedman be the
other.â

So they put up the money anâ Eugene was to have six weeks to get his
squirrel; anâ from that on we begun to divide up into rival camps.
Theâ wasnât any tree squirrels out in that neck oâ the woods, anâ we
had all forgot what wild squirrels really was like. We knew theâ was
ground-squirrels, red squirrels, gray squirrels, anâ
flyinâ-squirrelsâalthough an argument was started about there beinâ
flyinâ-fish all right, but no flyinâ-squirrels, which would have ended
in warfare if Eugene hadnât been handy to settle it.

You wouldnât think that a little thing like a bet about the size of a
squirrel would take the way it did; but Eugene was so confident on his
side, anâ olâ man Dort was so dead sure of Ben Butler, that the rest
of us split up anâ we each had a little side bet on the outcome. It
seemed a tarnation long time while we was waitinâ; but in a little
over a month, Eugene got a big box which he took into his back room
without lettinâ even the fellers who had backed his squirrel get a
peep at it.

From that on we got shaved twice a day anâ our heads washed till the
hair started to change color; so that Eugeneâs trade was so improved
that even if he lost the bet, he was money ahead; but he scoffed the
idy oâ losinâ the bet, even after his squirrel arrived; and as he was
the only man who had seen both the contestants, he had the whole
country up in the air.

Olâ man Dort had made his squirrel run around the wheel four hours a
day, pokinâ him up with a stick when he got lazy; anâ this gave Ben
Butler sech a prodigious appetite that the olâ man had to set up late
at night to give him an extra meal. As the day oâ settlement came
closer, the olâ man tapered off on the exercise, anâ doubled up on the
feed, until Ben Butler looked a full size larger, anâ us fellers who
had our money on Eugeneâs squirrel began to get shaky. If it had been
just an even race, it would have been a fair deal; but to have to show
a squirrel three times larger than Ben Butler seemed an impossibility.

Eugene had been fussinâ over his entry too, anâ we used to sneak up
behind his shop at nights to listen to him. We could hear him snippinâ
with scissors and pullinâ stoppers out oâ bottles and when he was
through heâd say: âStand up there, Columbusââwhich was the name of
his champion, anâ then he would seem to pass in a bunch oâ feed, anâ
sayââGood boy, Columbus! that dwarf red squirrel can turn a double
handspring in your shadder.â

This used to hearten us up again, and weâd lay a little more money on
Eugeneâs squirrel. Ike, anâ Bill, anâ Danâthe judgesâsaid that they
didnât claim to know anything about the breeds oâ squirrels, anâ all
they was to judge on was the size, which would be settled by weight if
theâ was any dispute. They got kind oâ nervous toward the end, âcause
the fellers were all on edge, anâ a rank decision meant trouble in
bunches.

When the final day oâ settlement arrived, Boggs was seven deep with
fellers on edge to see the outcome. Most of us had all we could spare
hung up in bets; but theâ was still a lot oâ coin in the crowd, and a
crew came over from Cheyenne to take charge of it.

They had a game which certainly was attractive, Iâll say that much for
it. It was a round board full oâ numbers, and up the middle was a
tower with slopinâ sides covered with nails. A marble was dropped into
a hole at the top and bobbled on the nails until it went into a row of
holes at the bottom, and came out in a groove leadinâ to one oâ the
numbers. Some oâ these numbers doubled the playerâs money, some of âem
paid it over to the table; but most of âem was neutral, and a feller
had to double what he already had up, in order to stand a show. It was
an innocent-appearinâ game, but deceptive. When a feller had up all he
could raise, some stranger would offer him two bits for his chance,
put up the doublinâ moneyâand win. This was a capper oâ course; but
crowds donât have any sense when they start gamblinâ, and this crew
was cleaninâ us out until, all of a sudden, I heard a clear, low-toned
voice say: âIf one oâ you boys would upset that table, youâd see the
lever which controls the marble.â

I glanced up, and there was the Singinâ Parson, as cool as a frozen
fish. Olâ Tom Williams, commonly known as âTank,â had just lost six
dollars, and he upset the table and saw just how tight braced the
blame game was. Then he unlimbered his gun, and suggested that he
would feel calmer if he had the six dollars back, and the Cheyenne
gambler looked into Tankâs free eye, which was pointinâ at the
ceilinâ, and he seconded Tankâs motion. After this the rest oâ the
boys collected what they felt was due âem, and the Cheyenne crowd had
to fall back on charity for their noon lunch.

Just about one oâclock, the head crook saw the Singinâ Parson standinâ
close to Eugeneâs barber shop. The shop was locked, and the crowd
around was lookinâ at it. The crook didnât want to attract any
attention; so, instead oâ usinâ a gun, he struck at the Parson with a
club. He miscalculated, and hit the shoulder instead oâ the head. The
Parson whirled, grabbed the club with his left hand, and the crookâs
shirt collar with his right. The crook started to pull; but we settled
down on him, and were all ready to serve out justice, when the Parson
interrupted to say that it was none of our business, and if weâd just
form a ring, heâd settle it to everybodyâs satisfaction. He said he
expected to live among us for the rest of his life, and this would be
a good time to introduce his methods.

We took off the crookâs weapons, and then formed a big ring. The
Parson was smilinâ a business-like smile, while the crook was palinâ
up noticeable. âI am convinced that a man must settle some things,
himself, in a new country,â sez the Parson. âI am larger than you, so
it is fair for you to use this club; but I warn you in advance that I
understand how to guard againâ clubs, so do your best. Iâm ready,
begin.â

It was quite eddifyinâ to behold: the crook made a vicious smash at
the Parsonâs head, the Parson bent his arm at the elbow, muscle out,
so the bone wouldnât get bruised, stepped in, and hit the crook a
swing in the short ribs. Some say it lifted him ten feet, some say
only eight; but any way, when he lit, he gave a grunt like an empty
barrel, and the Parson had no trouble in layinâ him over his knee and
givinâ him the most liberal spankinâ with that club I ever was
spectator to; while the crowd howled itself hoarse in the throat.

Now the Parson wasnât angry, he grinned all the way through, and when
he had taken as much exercise as he felt was good for him, he set the
crook on his feet, and talked fatherly advice to him as sober anâ
dignified as was possibleâconsiderinâ the fact that the crook was
dancinâ about like a spider on a hot skillet, and rubbinâ the part
which had got most intimate with the club.

Eugene had seen it all through his window, and when it was over, he
came out and shook the Parsonâs hand, and said he was just the kind
needed in such an ungodly community, and that he reminded him for all
the world of Friar Tuck in Robin Hood. Now, we hadnât none of us heard
of Friar Tuck up to that time; but it was a name well fitted to the
tongue, and from the way Eugene said it, we elected it was a
compliment; so we gave it to the Singinâ Parson on the spot, and it
soaked into his bones, and he hasnât needed any other since.

This little incident kept us all in a good humor until three oâclock,
which was the fatal hour for the squirrel-contest.

Then olâ man Dort marched to the center oâ the street, carryinâ his
cage as though it was full oâ diamonds; anâ Ben Butler sat up anâ
chattered as if he was darinâ the whole race oâ squirrels to bring
forth his equal.

âI donât reckon a squirrel could get three times as big as him without
explodinâ,â sez Spider Kelley, who also had his money on Eugeneâs
squirrel.

âHere comes Eugene with Columbus,â sez I, not carinâ to waste breath
on an opinion I had backed up with good money.

Eugene came down the street carryinâ one end of a box, with Doc Forbes
carryinâ the other. The box was covered with a clean apron, anâ Eugene
wasnât lookinâ down in the mouth or discouraged.

âFrom the size oâ that box, weâre goinâ to have a run for our money,â
sez Spider. âIf Columbus just looks good enough to make âem settle by
the scales, I havenât any kick cominâ.â

Well, as Eugene drew closer, that crowd fell into a silence until all
a body could hear was Ben Butler bragginâ about all the nuts he had
et, anâ what a prodigious big squirrel he was; but Eugene never
faltered. He walked up anâ set his box down careful, motioned Doc over
to the side lines, made a graceful motion to olâ man Dort, anâ sez:
âAs yours is the local champion you introduce him first, anâ make your
claim.â

Olâ man Dort removed his tobacco, wiped his forehead, anâ sez: âFeller
citizens, I make the claim that Ben Butler is the biggest full-blooded
squirrel ever sent to enlighten the solitude of lonely humanity. This
is him.â

The olâ man looked lovinâly down at his squirrel, anâ we every one of
us gave a rousinâ cheer. It was all the family the olâ man had, anâ it
meant more to him ân a body who hadnât never tried standinâ his own
company months at a time could realize. Olâ man Dort thrust some new
tobacco into his face, bit his lips, winked his eyes rapid, anâ bowed
to us, almost overcome.

Then Eugene stepped a space to the front, bowed to the crowd in
several directions, anâ sez: âGentlemen, anâ feller citizensâFrom
Icelandâs icy mountains to Indiaâs coral strands anâ Africâs sunny
fountains, every nation anâ every clime has produced some peculiar
product oâ nature which lifts it above anâ sets it apart from all the
other localities of the globe. When you speak of the succulent banana,
the golden orange, or the prickly pineapple, Nova Scotia remains
silent; but when you speak of varmints, she rears up on her hind legs
and with a glad shout of triumph, she hands forth the short-tailed
grizzly ground-squirrel, anâ sez, âGive me the blue ribbons, the gold
medals, anâ the laurel crowns of victory.â I have the rare pleasure
anâ the distinctive honor of presenting to your notice Columbus, the
hugest squirrel ever exhibited within the confines of captivity.â

We was so took by Eugeneâs eloquence that we hardly noticed him slip
the apron from in front of his cage; but when we did look, we could
hardly get our breath. I was standinâ close to the Friar; and at first
he looked puzzled, and then his face lit up with a regular boyâs grin;
but he didnât say a word.

Columbus was certainly a giant; he stood full two feet tall as he sat
up anâ scrutinized around with a bossy sort of grin. He was dappled
fawn color on the sides with a curly black streak down the back anâ
sort oâ chestnut-red below, with a short tail anâ teeth like chisels.
He won so blame easy that even us what had bet on him didnât cheer.

Olâ man Dort give a grin, thinkinâ Ben Butler must have won, anâ then
he stepped around anâ looked into Eugeneâs cage. He looked first at
Columbus, anâ then at Ben Butler, then he looked again. âThat damned
thing ainât alive,â he sez. âItâs made up out oâ wool yarn. Poke it up
anâ let me see it move.â

âPoke it yourself,â sez Eugene. He was one oâ these cold-blooded
gamblers who ainât got one speck oâ decent sentimentality; anâ he was
mad âcause we hadnât cheered.

Olâ man Dort took a stick anâ poked Columbus, anâ Columbus give a
threateninâ grin, chattered savage, anâ bit the stick in two. âGive
him the money, Ike,â sez olâ man Dort. âI own up I never was in Nova
Scotia, anâ I never supposed that such squirrels as this grew on the
face oâ the whole earth. Whatâll you take for him?â he sez to Eugene.

âIt ainât your fault that you didnât know about him,â sez Eugene,
thawinâ a little humanity into himself. âI donât want to rub it in on
nobody; and Iâll give you this here squirrel free gratis, âcause I
admit that you know more about squirrels ân anybody else what ever I
met; anâ you have the biggest red squirrel theâ is in the world.â

Then we did give Eugene a cheer, anâ everything loosened up, anâ we
all crowded into Ike Spargleâs so that them what won could spend a
little money on them what lost.

After a time, olâ man Dort got up on a chair, anâ sez: âI want you
fellers to know that Columbus wonât never be my pet. Ben Butler has
been the squarest squirrel ever was, anâ he continues to remain my
pet; but Iâll study feedinâ this condemned foreign squirrel, anâ give
him a fair show; so that if any outsiders come around makinâ brags, we
will have a home squirrel to enter againâ âem anâ get their money.â

Eugene led the cheerinâ this time, which made Eugene solider than ever
with the boys, anâ when Spider anâ me got ready to ride home, he anâ
olâ man Dort had their arms around each other tryinâ to sing the Star
Spangled Banner.

Spider talked about Columbus most oâ the way home, but I was still.
Theâ was somethinâ peculiar about the Friarâs grin when he first
sighted Columbus, and theâ was somethinâ familiar about that squirrel,
anâ I was tryinâ to adjust myself. Just as we swung to the west on the
last turn, I sez to Spider: âSpider, I donât know what I ought to do
about this?â

âAbout what?â sez Spider.

âAbout this bet?â

âWell, it was a fair bet, wasnât it? Columbus is full four times as
big as Ben Butler.â

âYes,â sez I, âbut he ainât no squirrel.â

Spider pulled up to a stop. âAinât no squirrel?â he sez. âWhat do you
take me for, didnât I see him myself? What is he then?â

âHeâs a woodchuck, thatâs what he is,â sez I. âHeâs a genuwine ground
hog with his hair cut stylish and died accordinâ to Eugeneâs idy of
high art. I remember now that I used to see âem when I was a little
shaver back on my dadâs farm in Indiana.â

Spider give a whoop, anâ then he laughed, anâ then he sobered up, anâ
sez: âWell, you canât do nothinâ now, anyway. The judges have decided
it, olâ man Dort has give it up, it ainât your game nohow, anâ if you
was to try to equal back those bets after they have been paid anâ
mostly spent, youâd start a heap oâ blood-spillinâ; anâ furthermore,
as far as Iâm concerned, I ainât right sure but what a woodchuck, as
you call it, ainât some kind of a squirrel. Weâll just let this go anâ
wait for a chance to put something over on Eugene.â

So thatâs what we made up to do; but this gives you an idy of how fine
a line the Friar drew on questions oâ sport. He knew âat we werenât
full fledged angels, and that we had to have our little diversities;
but when any professional hold-up men tried to ring in a brace game on
us, he couldnât see any joke in it, and he upset the money-changersâ
tables, the same as they was upset that time, long ago, in the temple.




CHAPTER THREE

ABOVE THE DUST


Iâm only about twice as old as I feel; but Iâve certainly seen a lot
oâ changes take place out this way. I can look back to the time when
what most of us called a town was nothinâ but a log shack with a
barrel of cheap whiskey and a mail-bag wanderinâ in once a month or
so, from goodness-knows-where. Iâve seen the cattle kings when they
set their own bounds, made their own laws, and cared as little for
government-title as they did for an Injunâs. Then, Iâve seen the sheep
men creep in an inch at a time until they ate the range away from the
cattle and began to jump claims anâ tyrannize as free and joyous as
the cattle men had. Next came the dry farmer, and he was as comical as
a bum lamb when he first hove into sight; but I reckon that sooner or
later heâll be the one to write the final laws for this section.

Weâre gettinâ a good many towns on our map nowadays, weâre puttinâ up
a lot oâ hay, weâre drinkinâ cow milk, and weâre eatinâ garden truck
in the summer. The old West has dried up and blown away before our
very eyes, and a few of us old timers are beginninâ to feel like the
last oâ the buffalo. Theâs more money nowadays in boardinâ dudes ân
theâ is in herdinâ cattle, anâ thatâs the short of a long, long story.

But still we hammered out this country from the rough, and no one can
take that away from us. The flag follers trouble, anâ business follers
the flag, anâ law follers business, anâ trouble follers the law; but
always the first trouble was kicked up by boys who had got so âat they
couldnât digest home cookinâ any longer and just nachely had to get
out anâ tussle with nature anâ the heathen.

Theyâre a tough, careless lot, these young adventurers; anâ theyâre
always in a state of panic lest the earth get so crowded theâ wonât be
room enough to roll over in bed without askinâ permission; so they
kill each other off as soon as possible, and thus make room for the
patienter ones who follow after. From what Iâve heard tell of history,
this has been about the way that the white race has managed from the
very beginning.

As a general rule it has been purtâ nigh a drawn fight between the
dark-skins anâ the wild animals; then the lads who had to have more
elbow-room came along, and the dark-skins and the wild animals had to
be put onto reservations to preserve a few specimens as curiosities,
while the lads fussed among themselves, each one tryinâ to settle down
peaceable with his dooryard lappinâ over the horizon in all
directions. Room, room, roomâthat was their constant cry. As soon as
one would get a neighbor within a dayâs ride, heâd begin to feel shut
in anâ smothered.

Tyrrel Jones was one oâ the worst oâ this breed. He came out at an
early date, climbed the highest peak he could find, and claimed
everything âat his gaze could reach in every direction. Then he
invented the Cross brand, put it on a few cows, and made ready to
defend his rights. The Cross brand was a simple one, just one straight
line crossinâ another; and it could be put on in about one second with
a ventinâ iron, or anything else which happened to be handy. Tyrrel
thought a heap oâ this brand, anâ he didnât lose any chances of
puttinâ it onto saleable property. His herd grew from the very
beginning.

His home ranch was something over a hundred miles northwest oâ the
Diamond Dot; but I allus suspicioned that a lot of our doggies had the
Cross branded on to âem. Tyrrel was mighty particular in the kind oâ
punchers he hired. He liked fellers who had got into trouble, anâ the
deeper they was in, the better he liked âem. Character seeks its
level, the same as water; so that Tyrrel had no trouble in gettinâ as
many oâ the breed he wanted as he had place for. They did his
devilment free and hearty, and when they had a little spare time, they
used to devil on their own hook in a way to shame an Injun.

The sayinâ was, that a Cross brand puncher could digest every sort oâ
beef in the land except Cross brand beef. Tyrrel used to grin at this
sayinâ as though it was a sort of compliment; but some oâ the little
fellers got purty bitter about it. When a small outfit located on a
nice piece oâ water, it paid âem to be well out oâ Tyâs neighborhood.
No one ever had any luck who got in his road; but his own luck boomed
right along year after year. He allus kept more men than he needed;
anâ about once a month heâd knock in the head of a barrel oâ whiskey,
anâ the tales they used to tell about these times was enough to raise
the hair. Ty would work night anâ day to get one of his men out of a
scrape; but once a man played him false, he either had to move or get
buried. He wasnât a bad lookinâ man, except that he allus seemed keyed
up anâ ready to spring.

His men all had to be top-notch riders, because he hadnât any use for
a gentle hoss; he didnât want his hosses trained, he wanted âem
busted, anâ the cavey heâd send along for a round-up would be about as
gentle and reliable as a band oâ hungry wolves. If a man killed a
hoss, why Ty seemed to think it a good joke, anâ this was his gait all
the way alongâthe rougher the men were, the better they suited him.
He kept a pack oâ dogs, and the men were encouraged to kick anâ abuse
âem; but if one of âem petted a dog, he was fired that instantâor
else lured into a quarrel. Theâ didnât seem to be one single soft spot
left in the man, anâ when they got to callinâ him Tyrant Jones instead
of Tyrrel, why, it suited him all over, anâ he used it himself once in
a while.

The next time I saw Friar Tuck, he recognized me at first glance, anâ
his face lit up as though we had been out on some prank together anâ
was the best pals in the world ever since. He wanted to know all I
knew about the crowd that had started to string him up; and when I had
finished paintinâ âem as black as I could, what did he do but say that
he was goinâ up their way to have a talk with âem.

I told him right out that it was simply wastinâ time; but he was set
in his ways, so I decided to ride part way with him. He had two hosses
along this trip, with his bed anâ grub tied on the spare one; and on
the second day we reached a little park just as the sun was setting.
It was one oâ the most beautiful spots I ever saw, high enough to get
a grand view off to the west, but all the rest shut in like a little
room. He jumped from his hoss, had his saddle off as soon as I did,
and also helped me with the pack. Then he looked about the place.

âWhat a grand cathedral this is, Happy!â he sez after a minute.

I didnât sense what he meant right at first, and went on makinâ camp,
until I happened to notice his expression. He was lookinâ off to the
west with the level rays of the sun as it sank down behind a distant
range full in his face. The twilight had already fallen over the low
land and all the hazy blues anâ purples anâ lavenders seemed to be
floatinâ in a misty sea, with here anâ there the black shadows of
peaks stickinâ out like islands. It really was gorgeous when you
stopped to give time to it.

It had been gruelinâ hot all day, anâ was just beginninâ to get cool
anâ restful, and I was feelinâ the jerk of my appetite; but when I
noticed his face I forgot all about it. I stood a bit back of him,
half watchinâ him, anâ half watchinâ the landscape. Just as the sun
sank, he raised his hands and chanted, with his great, soft voice
booming out over the hills: âThe Lord is in His holy templeâlet all
the earth keep silence before Him.â

He bent his head, anâ I bent mineâIâd have done it if theâd been a
knife-point stickinâ againâ my chin. I tell you, it was solemn! It
grew dark in a few moments anâ the evening star came out in all her
glory. It was a still, clear night without a speck in the air, and she
was the only star in sight; but she made up for it, all right, by
throwing out spikes a yard long.

He looked up at it for a moment, and then sang a simple little hymn
beginninâ, âNow the day is over, night is drawing nigh; shadows of the
evening steal across the sky.â It didnât have the ring to it of most
of his songs; it was just close anâ friendly, and filled a feller with
peace. It spoke oâ the little children, and those watchinâ in pain,
and the sailors tossinâ on the deep blue sea, and those who planned
evilârounded âem all up and bespoke a soothinâ night for âem; and I
venture to say that it did a heap oâ good.

Then he pitched in anâ helped me get supper. This was his way; he
didnât wear a long face and talk doleful; he was full oâ life anâ
boilinâ over with it every minute, and heâd turn his hand to whatever
came up anâ joke anâ be the best company in the world; but he never
got far from the Lord; and when heâd stop to worship, why, the whole
world seemed to stop and worship with him.

We had a merry meal and had started to wash up the dishes when he
happened to glance up again. He had just been tellinâ me a droll story
about the first camp heâd ever made, and how he had tied on his pack
so âat the hoss couldnât comfortably use his hind legs and had bucked
all his stuff into a crick, anâ I was still laughinâ; but when he
looked up, my gaze followed his. It was plumb dark by now, anâ that
evening star was fair bustinâ herself, and the light of it turned the
peaks a glisteny, shadowy silver. He raised his hands again and
chanted one beginning: âPraise the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
within me, praise His holy name.â

Theâ was a part in this one which called upon all the works oâ the
Lord to praise Him, and I glanced about to see what was happeninâ. A
faint breeze had sprung up and the spruce trees were bowinâ over
reverently, the ponies had raised their heads and their eyes were
shininâ soft and bright in the firelight as they looked curiously at
the singer; and as I stood there with a greasy skillet in my hand,
something inside of me seemed to get down on its knees, to worship
with the other works oâ the Lord.

It was one oâ those wonderful moments which seem to brand themselves
on a fellerâs memory, and I can see it all now, and hear the Friarâs
voice as it floated away into the hills until it seemed to be caught
up by other voices rather than to die away.

Well, we sat up about the fire a long time that night. He didnât fuss
with me about my soul, or gettinâ saved, or such things. I told him
the things I didnât understand, and he told me the things he didnât
understand; and I told him about some oâ my scrapes, and he told me
about some oâ his, andâwell, I canât see where it was so different
from a lot of other nights; but I suppose Iâd be sitting there yet if
he hadnât finally said it was bedtime.

He stood up and looked at the star again, and chanted the one which
begins: âLord, now let thy servant depart in peaceâ; after which he
pulled off some of his clothes and crawled into the tarp. I crawled in
beside him about two minutes later; but he was already asleep, while I
lay there thinkinâ for the best part of an hour.

Next morninâ he awakened me by singinâ, âBrightest and best of the
sons of the morningâ; and after that we got breakfast, and he started
on to Ty Jonesâs while I turned back to the Diamond Dot. I didnât
think heâd be able to do much with that gang; but after the talk Iâd
had with him the night before, I saw âat they couldnât do much to him,
either. I had got sort of a hint at his scheme of life; and there
isnât much you can do to a man who doesnât value his flesh more ân the
Friar did his.




CHAPTER FOUR

TY JONES


Ty stood in his door as the Friar rode up, and he recognized him from
the description Badger-face had turned in. Badger-face had been purty
freely tongue-handled for not havinâ lynched the Friar, and Ty Jones
was disposed to tilt his welcome even farther back than usual; so he
set his pack on the Friar. He had six dogs at this time, mastiffs with
a wolf-cross in âem which about filled out his notion oâ what a dog
ought to be.

The Friar had noticed the dogs, but he didnât have an idee that any
man would set such creatures on another man; so he had dismounted to
get a drink oâ water from the crick, it havinâ been a hot ride. The
pack came surginâ down on him while he was lyinâ flat anâ drinkinâ out
oâ the crick. His ponies were grazinâ close by, and as soon as he saw
âat the dogs meant business, he vaulted into the saddle just in time
to escape âem.

They leaped at him as fast as they came up, and he hit âem with the
loaded end of his quirt as thorough as was possible. He was ridinâ a
line buckskin with a nervous disposition, and the pony kicked one or
two on his own hook; but as the Friar leaned over in puttinâ down the
fifth, the sixth jumped from the opposite side, got a holt on his arm
just at the shoulder, anâ upset him out of the saddle. In the fall the
dogâs grip was broke anâ he and the Friar faced each other for a
moment, the Friar squattinâ on one knee with his fists close to his
throat, the dog crouchinâ anâ snarlinâ.

As the dog sprang, the Friar upper-cut him in the throat with his left
hand and when he straightened up, hit him over the heart with his
right. He says that a dogâs heart is poorly protected. Anything âat
didnât have steel over it was poorly protected when the Friar struck
with his right in earnest. The dog was killed. One oâ the dogs the
pony had kicked was also killed, but the other four was able to get up
and crawl away.

The Friar shook himself and went on to where Ty Jones and a few of his
men were standinâ. âThatâs a nice lively bunch oâ dogs you have,â sez
he, smilinâ as pleasant as usual; âbut they need traininâ.â

âThey suit me all right,â growls Ty, âexcept that theyâre too blame
clumsy.â

The Friar looked at him a minute, and then said drily, âYes, thatâs
what I said; they need traininâ.â

Ty Jones scowled: âThey donât get practice enough,â sez he. âItâs most
generally known that I ainât a-hankerinâ for company; so folks donât
usually come here, unless theyâre sure of a welcome.â

âI can well believe you,â said the Friar, laughinâ, âand I hope the
next time I come Iâll be sure of a welcome.â

âItâs not likely,â sez Ty shortly.

The Friar just stood and looked at him curiously. He didnât believe
that Ty could really mean it. Theâ wasnât a streak of anything in his
own make-up to throw light on a human actinâ the way âat Ty Jones
acted; so he just stood and examined him. Ty stared back with a sneer
on his face, and Iâm sorry I couldnât have been there to see âem
eyeinâ each other.

âDo you really mean,â sez the Friar at last, âthat you hate your
fellow humans so, that youâd drive a perfect stranger away from your
door?â

âI havenât any use for hoss-thieves,â sez Ty.

The Friars face lighted. âOh, thatâs all right,â sez he in a relieved
tone. âAs long as you have a special grievance againâ me, why, itâs
perfectly natural for you to act up to it. It wouldnât be natural for
most men to act up to it in just this way, but still itâs normal;
while for a man to set his dogs on a total stranger would be
monstrous. Iâm glad to know âat you had some excuse; but as far as
hoss-stealinâ goes, that roan is back with your band again. I saw him
as I came along.â

Ty was somewhat flabbergasted. He wasnât used to havinâ folks try out
his conduct and comment on it right to his face; and especially was he
shocked to have his morals praised by a preacher. He knew âat such a
reception as had just been handed to the Friar would have taken the
starch out oâ most men anâ filled âem with a desire for revenge ever
after; but he could see that the Friar was not thinkinâ of what had
been handed to him, he was actually interested in himself, Ty Jones,
and was honestly tryinâ to see how it was possible for such a
condition to exist; and this set Ty Jones back on his haunches for
true.

âFor all time to come,â he sez slow and raspy, âI want you to leave my
stuff alone. If you ever catch up and ride one of my hosses again,
Iâll get your hide; and I donât even want you on my land.â

Then the Friar stiffened up; any one in the world, or any thing, had
the right to impose upon the Friar as a man; but when they tried to
interfere with what he spoke of as his callinâ, why, he swelled up
noticeable. The Friarâs humility was genuine, all right; but it was
about four times stiffer anâ spikier than any pride Iâve ever met up
with yet.

âI shall not ride your hosses,â sez he, scornful, ânor shall I tread
upon your land, nor shall I breathe your air, nor drink your water;
but in the future, as in the past, I shall use for the Lord only those
things which belong to the Lord. The things which are the Lordâs were
His from the beginning, the things which you call yours are merely
entrusted to your care for a day or an hour or a moment. I do not
covet your paltry treasures, I covet your soul and I intend to fight
you for it from this day forward.â

The Friar spoke in a low, earnest tone; and Ty Jones stared at him. Ya
know how earnest an insane man gets? Well, theâ was something oâ this
in the Friar when he was talkinâ business. You felt that he believed
that what he was sayinâ was the truth, and you felt that if it was the
truth, it was mighty well worth heedinâ, and you also felt that in
spite of its beinâ so everlastinâ different from the usual view oâ
things, it might actually be the truth after all and a risky thing to
pass up careless.

After waitinâ a minute without gettinâ a reply, the Friar turned on
his heel to walk away, stumbled, and slipped to the ground, and then
they noticed a pool of blood which had dripped from him as he stood.
He had forgotten that the dog had torn him, anâ the men had looked
into his eyes, as men always did when he talked, and they had forgot
it, too. Now, when he fell, Olaf the Swede stepped forward to help him
up.

Olaf was the best man âat Ty Jones had, from Tyâs own standpoint. Ty
had happened to be over at Skeltyâs one night when Skelty was givinâ a
dance. Skelty had six girls at this time, anâ he used to give a dance
about once a week. Along about midnight, they got to be purty lively
affairs. This night Skelty had bragged what a fine shot he was, anâ
the boys were kiddinâ him about it, because Skelty wasnât no shot at
all as a rule. It was a moonlight night, and while they was sheepinâ
Skelty about his shootinâ, two strangers rode up, tied their hosses to
the corral, anâ started up the path toward the door.

Skelty looked at âem anâ sez, âWhy, if I had a mind to, I could pick
one oâ those fellers off with this gun as easy as I could scratch my
nose.â He pulled his gun and held it over his shoulder.

All the boys fair hooted, anâ Skelty dropped his gun anâ shot one oâ
the strangers dead in his tracks. The other came along on the run with
Skelty shootinâ at him as fast as he could pop; but he only shot him
once, through the leg, and he limped in anâ made for Skelty with his
bare hands. Skelty hit him in the forehead, knocked him down anâ
jumped on him. He kept on beatinâ him over the head until the stranger
managed to get a grip on his wrists. He held one hand still, anâ
puttinâ the other into his mouth, bit off the thumb.

Theâs somethinâ about beinâ bit on the thumb which melts a manâs
nerve; and in about five minutes, the stranger had Skeltyâs head
between his knees, and was makinâ him eat his own gun. It must have
been a hideous sight! Some say that he actually did make Skelty eat
it, and some say that he only tore through the throat; but anyway,
Skelty didnât quite survive it, and Ty Jones hired the stranger, which
was Olaf the Swede.

Olaf was one oâ those Swedes which seem a mite too big for their
skins. The bones in his head stuck out, his jaws stuck out prodigious,
his shoulders stuck out, his hands stuck outâhe fair loomed up and
seemed to crowd the landscape, and he was stouter ân a bull. When he
let himself go he allus broke somethinâ; but he had a soft streak in
him for animals, anâ Ty never could break him from beinâ gentle with
hosses, nor keep him from pettinâ the dogs once in a while. Olaf
hadnât no more morals ân a snake at this time, anâ when it came to
dealinâ with humans, he suited Ty to the minute; but he just simply
wouldnât torture an animal, and that was the end of it. Olaf wasnât a
talkinâ man; he never used a word where a grunt would do, and he was
miserly about them; but he certainly was set in his ways.

The Friar hadnât fainted, he had just gone dizzy; so when Olaf gave
him a lift he got to his feet and walked to his horse. He allus
carried some liniment anâ such in his saddle bags, anâ he pulled off
his shirt and cleaned out the wound and tied it up, with Olaf standinâ
by and tryinâ to help. Now, it made something of a murmur, when the
Friar took off his shirt. In the first place, the dog had give him an
awful tear, and for the rest, the Friar was a wonderful sight to
behold. He was as strong as Olaf without beinâ bulgey, and his skin
was as white and smooth as ivory. He was all curves and tapers with
medium small hands and feet, and a throat clean cut and shapely like
the throat of a high-bred mare. Olaf looked at him, and nodded his
head solemnly. Badger-face hated Olaf, because Olaf had a curious way
of estimatinâ things and havinâ âem turn out to be so, which made Ty
Jones put faith in what Olaf said, over and above what any one else
said.

As soon as the Friar had finished tyinâ up the wound, he turned and
walked up to Ty Jones. âFriend,â he said, âI donât bear you a grain oâ
malice, and nothing you can ever do to me will make me bear you a
grain oâ malice. I know a lot about medicine, and perhaps I can help
you that way sometime. I want to get a start with you some way; I want
to be welcome here, and I wish âat youâd give me a chance.â

âOh, hell!â sneered Ty Jones. âDo you think you can soft-soap me as
easy as you did the boys? Youâre not welcome here now, and you never
will be. Iâve heard all this religious chatter, and thereâs nothinâ in
it. The world was always held by the strong, by the men who hated
their enemies and stamped them out as fast as they got a chance; and
it always will be held by the strong. Your religion is only for
weaklings and hypocrits.â

The Friarâs face lighted. âWill you discuss these things with me?â he
asked. âI shall not eat until this scratch is healed, I have my own
bed and will not bother you; wonât you just be decent enough to invite
me to camp here, give me free use of water, and grass for my hosses,
while you and I discuss these things fully?â

âI told you I didnât want you about, and I donât,â sez Ty. âTheâs
nothinâ on earth so useless as a preacher, and I canât stand âem.â

âLet me work for you,â persisted the Friar. âAll I ask is a chance to
show âat Iâm able to do a manâs work, and all the pay I ask is a
chance to hold service here on Sundays. If I donât do my work well,
then you can make me the laughinâ stock oâ the country; but I tell you
right now that if you turn me away without a show, it will do you a
lot more harm than it will me.â

Ty thought âat probably the Friar had got wind oâ some of his
devilment, and was hintinâ that his own neck depended on his men
keepinâ faith with him; so he stared at the Friar to see if it was a
threat.

The Friar looked back into his eyes with hope beaminâ in his own; but
after a time Ty Jones scowled down his brows anâ pointed the way âat
the Friar had come. âGo,â sez he, stiff as ever. âTheâ ainât any room
for you on the Cross brand range; and if ya try anything underhanded,
Iâll hunt ya down and put ya plumb out oâ the way.â

So the Friar he caught his ponies and hit the back trail; but still it
had been purty much of a drawn battle, for Ty Jonesâs men had used
their eyes and their ears, and they had to give in to themselves âat
the preacher had measured big any way ya looked at him; while their
own boss had dogged it in the manger to a higher degree ân even they
could take glory in.

As the Friar rode away, he sagged in his saddle with his head bent
over; and they thought him faint from his wound; but the truth was,
that he was only a little sad to think âat he had lost. He was human,
the Friar was; he used to chide himself for presumptinâ to be
impatient; but at the same time he used to fidget like a nervous hoss
when things seemed to stick in the sand; and he didnât sing a note as
long as he was on the Cross brand rangeâwhich same was an uncommon
state for the Friar to be in, him generally marchinâ to music.




CHAPTER FIVE

THE HOLD-UP


This was the way the Friar started out with us; and year after year,
this was the way he kept up. He was friendly with every one, and most
every one was friendly with him. Some oâ the boys got the idea that he
packed his guns along as a bluff; so they put up a joke on him.

They lay in wait for him one night as he was cominâ up the goose neck.
I, myself, didnât rightly savvy just how he did stand with regard to
the takinâ of human life in self-defence; but I knew mighty well âat
he wasnât no bluffer, so I didnât join in with the boys, nor I didnât
warn him; I just scouted along on the watch and got up the hill out oâ
range to see what would happen.

He came up the hill in the twilight, singinâ one of his favorite
marchinâ songs. Iâve heard it hundreds of times since then, and Iâve
often found myself singinâ it softly to myself when I had a long,
lonely ride to make. That was a curious thing about the Friar: he
didnât seem to be tampinâ any of his idees into a feller, but first
thing the feller knew, he had picked up some oâ the Friarâs ways; and,
as the Friar confided to me once, a good habit is as easy learned as a
bad, and twice as comfortinâ.

Well, he came up the pass shufflinâ along at a steady Spanish trot as
was usual with him when not overly rushed, and singinâ:

    âGuide me, O Thou great Jehovah!
      Pilgrim through this barren land;
    I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
      Hold me with Thy powerful hand.â

He came up out of the pass with his head thrown back, and his boyâs
face shininâ with that radiatinâ joy I havenât ever seen in another
face, exceptinâ it first caught the reflection from the Friarâs; and
the notion about died out oâ the boysâ minds. They were all friends of
his and wouldnât have hurt his feelinâs for a lot; but they had itched
about his weapons for such a spell that they finally had to have it
out; so when he rounded a point oâ rock, they stepped out and told him
to put his hands up.

They were masked and had him covered, and his hands shot up with a
jerk; but he didnât stop his singinâ, and his voice didnât take on a
single waver. Fact was, it seemed if possible a shade more jubilant.
He had reached the verse which sez:

    âFeed me with the heavenly manna
      In this barren wilderness;
    Be my sword and shield and banner,
      Be the Lord my Righteousnessâ;

and as he sang with his hands held high above his head, he waved âem
back and forth, playinâ notes in the air with his fingers, the way he
did frequent; and it was one oâ the most divertinâ sights I ever saw.

Those blame scamps had all they could do to keep from humminâ time to
his song; for I swear to you in earnest that the Friar could play on a
manâs heart the same as if it was a fiddle. He kept on anâ finished
the last verse while I crouched above âem behind a big rock, and
fairly hugged myself with the joy of it. Olâ Tank Williams was a big
man and had been chosen out to be the leader anâ do the talkinâ, but
he hadnât the heart to jab into the Friarâs singinâ; so he waited
until it was all over. Then he cleared his throat as though settinâ
off a blast of dynamite, and growls out: âHere, you, give us your
money.â

Ten six-shooters were pointinâ at the Friar, but I reckon if he had
known it would of exploded all of âem, heâd have had to laugh. He
threw back his head and his big free laugh rolled out into the hills,
until I had to gnaw at a corner oâ the stone to keep from joininâ in.
âMy money!â sez he as soon as he could catch his breath. âWell, boys,
boys, whatever put such a notion as that into your heads. Take it,
take it, youâre welcome to it; and if you are able to find more than
two bits, why, I congratulate you most hearty; because two bits was
all I could find this morning, and that will only be a nickle apiece,
and five cents is small pay for robbinâ a volunteer missionary.â

Olâ Tank Williams was a serious-minded old relic, and he was feelinâ
so sheepish just then that it seemed to him as though the Friar had
imposed on him by lurinâ him into such a fix; so he roars out in
earnest: âIf you ainât got no money, why the deuce do ya tote those
guns about with ya all the time?â

âWould you just as soon tie me to a tree, or take some other measures
of defence?â asked the Friar politely. âMy arms are gettinâ weary and
I could talk more comfortable with âem hangingâ down.â

âAw put âem down, and talk on,â sez George Hendricks.

âThank you,â sez the Friar. âWell, now, boys, the man who doesnât take
the time to put a value on his own life, isnât likely to make that
life very much worth while. He mustnât overvalue it to such an extent
that he becomes a coward, nor he mustnât undervalue it to such an
extent that he becomes recklessâhe must take full time to estimate
himself as near as he is able.

âI donât know that I can allus keep from judginâ my fellow men; but I
am sure that I would not judge one to the extent of sayinâ that my
life was worth more than his, so I should never use a gun merely to
save my own life by takinâ away the life of another manâmuch less
would I use a gun in defence of money; but I am a purty good shot, and
sometimes I can get a man interested by shootinâ at a mark with him.
This is why I carry firearms. Do you want the two bits?â

âAw, go on,â yells olâ Tank, madder at himself ân ever. âWe didnât
intend to rob ya. All we wanted was to hear ya sing and preach a bitâ;
and he pulled off his mask and shook the Friarâs hand. All the rest oâ
the boys did the same; and I clumb up on my rock, flapped my wings,
and crowed like a rooster.

Well, we sat on the ground, and he sang for us; and then he sobered
and began to talk about cussinâ. It used to hurt the Friar to hear
some oâ the double-jointed swear words we used when excited. He tried
not to show it, because he didnât want anything to shut us away from
him at any time; but whiles his face would wrinkle into lines of
actual pain.

âNow, boys,â he began, âI know, âat you donât mean what you say in a
profane way. You call each other terrible names, and condemn each
other to eternal punishment; and if a man said these things in
earnest, his life would be forfeit; but you take it merely as a joke.
Now, I do not know just how wicked this is. I know that it is
forbidden to take the name oâ the Lord thy God in vain; so it is a
dangerous thing to be profane even in thoughtlessness; but I have
heard the Lordâs name used by the perfectly respectable in a way which
must have hurt his tender nature more.

âOnce in the crowded slum district of a large eastern city, I saw a
freight car back down on a child and kill it. The mother was frantic;
she was a foreigner and extra emotional, and she screamed, and cursed
the railroad. A man had come to comfort her, and he put his hand on
her arm and said, âMy dear woman, you must not carry on this way. We
must always bow our heads in submission to the Lordâs will.â

âFor years the poor people oâ that neighborhood had begged protection
for their children; and I cannot believe that it was the Lordâs will
that even one oâ the least of âem should have been slain in order to
drive the lesson a little deeper home; so, as I said before, I am not
going to talk to you of the wickedness of swearingâbut I am goinâ to
talk about its foolishness, its vulgarity, and its brutality.â

He went on showinâ that swearinâ was foolish because it wasnât givinâ
a manâs thought on things in a manâs way; but merely howlinâ it out
the way wolves and wild-cats had to, on account oâ their not havinâ a
civilized language with which to express the devilment which was in
âem. He showed how it made a feller lazy; because instead of tryinâ to
sort out words which would tell exactly what he meant, he made a lot
of noises which had no more real meaninâ than a bunch oâ
fire-crackers.

Then his voice got low and serious, and he said âat the worst thing
about cussinâ was, that it led a feller into speakinâ lightly about
the sacred things of life. âWhen you speak the word âson,ââ he said,
âyou are bound to also call up the thought of âmotherâ; and I want to
say to you right now that any one who can be coarse and nasty in
thinkinâ or speakinâ about maternity, is not a man at allâor even a
decent bruteâbut has some sort of soul-sickness which is more
horrible than insanity. Always be square with womenâall women, good
and bad. I know your temptations, and I know theirs. Woman has a heavy
cross to carry, and the least we can do, is to play fair.â

Then he sprang some of his curious theories on us: told us how the
body was full of poisons and remedies; and it depended on our plan of
livinâ, whether we used the one or the other. He said he allus cut out
food and tobacco on Fridays, and if he didnât feel bright and clear
and bubblinâ over with vitality, he fasted until he felt able to eat a
rubber boot, and then he knew he had cleaned all the waste products
out of him, and could live at top speed again. He finished up by
tellinâ of a cross old doctor he once knew, who used to say âat cattle
and kings didnât have to control themselves; but all ordinary men had
to use self-denial, even in matters of pleasure.

It was more the way the Friar said things than what he said; his voice
and his eyes helped a lot; but the thing âat counted for most was the
fact âat you knew it wasnât none of it put on. He loved to joke when
it was a jokinâ matter; but he was stiff as stone with what he called
the foundations of life. A man, you know, as a rule, is mighty timid
about the things which lie close to his heart, no matter how bold and
free heâll talk about other things; but the Friar was like a little
child, anâ heâd speak out as bold and frank as one, about the things
he loved and hated, until he finally put a few drops oâ this queer
brand oâ courage into our own hearts.

Of course we didnât get to be troubled with wing-growth or anything
like that; but a short time after this fake hold-up, olâ Tank Williams
went in to fill up with picklinâ-fluid, and he started in on Monday
and kept fightinâ it all that week until Friday. Then he said that he
wouldnât neither eat, drink, nor smoke on that day; and they couldnât
make him do it. He started in on Saturday to continue what had started
out to be one oâ the best benders he had ever took; but the first
quart made him sick as a dog, and he came out to the ranch and said
âat the Friar had made him a temperate man, and for the rest of his
life he intended to set aside one day a week in the Friarâs favor.

After the boys had started for the ranch, the Friar invited me to
spend the night with him; so we unpacked his bed from the lead-hoss
and we built a little fire and had a right sociable time of it. Me and
him was good pals by this time. He had said to me once: âHappy, you do
more general thinkinâ than some varsity men Iâve known.â

âI reckon,â sez I, modest as I could, âthat a man who has bossed a
dozen men and ten thousand cattle through a three daysâ blizzard, has
to be able to think some like a general.â

Then he explained to me that general thinkinâ meant to think about
stars anâ flowers anâ the human race anâ the past anâ the future, anâ
such things, and not to be all the time lookinâ at life just from the
way it touched a feller himself. This was another thing I liked about
him. Most Easteners is so polite that they havenât the heart to set a
feller right when he has the wrong notion; but the Friar would divvy
up on his knowledge as free as he would on his bacon or tobacco; so I
opened myself up to him until he knew as much about me as I did
myself.

He didnât have much use for the shut-eye this night, nor he wasnât as
talky as common; so we sat smokinâ and lookinâ into the fire for a
long time. Once in a while heâd speak a verse about some big deed a
man had done years ago, or else one describinâ the mountains or
something like that; until finally I asked him how it came that a man
who loved adventure anâ fightinâ anâ feats of skill, the way he did,
had selected to be a preacher.

âWe donât select our lives, Happy,â sez he. âYouâre surely philosopher
enough to see that. As far as we can see, it is like that gamblinâ
game; we roll down through a lot oâ little pegs bobbinâ off from one
to another until finally we pop into a little hole at the bottom; but
we didnât pick out that hole. No, we didnât pick out that hole.â

So I up and asked him to tell me somethinâ about his start.




CHAPTER SIX

A REMINISCENCE


I pity the man who has never slept out doors in the Rocky Mountains.
Swinginâ around with the earth, away up there in the starlight, he
fills himself full oâ new life with every breath; and no matter how
tough the day has been, he is bound to wake up the next morninâ plumb
rested, and with strength and energy fair dancinâ through his veins.
For it to be perfect, a feller has to have a pipe, a fire, and some
one close and chummy to chat with. This night me anâ the Friar both
went down to the crick and washed our feet. We sat on a log side by
side and made noises like a flock of bewildered geese when we first
stuck our feet into the icy water; but by the time we had raced back
and crawled into his bed, we were glowinâ all over.

We didnât cover up right away, because the Friar just simply couldnât
seem to get sleepy that night; and after a minute he put some more
wood on the fire, filled his pipe again, and said: âSo you want me to
tell you about my story, huh? Well, I believe I will tell you about my
boyhood.â

So I filled my pipe, and we lay half under the tarp with our heads on
our hands and our elbows on our boots, which were waitinâ to be
pillows, and he told me about the early days, talkinâ more to himself
than to me.

âMy mother died when I was six years old, my father divided his time
between cleaninâ out saloons, beatinâ me, anâ livinâ in the
work-house,â began the Friar, and it give me kind of a shock. Iâd had
a notion that such-like kids wasnât likely to grow up into preachers;
and Iâd allus supposed âat the Friar had had a soft, gentle youth. âI
was a tough, sturdy urchin,â he went on, âbut I allus had a soft heart
for animals. I used to fight several times a day; but mostly because
the other kids used to stone cats and tie tin cans on dogsâ tails. I
used to shine shoes, pass papers, run errands, and do any other odd
job for a few pennies, and at night I slept wherever I could. I had a
big dry-goods-box all to myself for several months, once, and I still
look back to it as being a fine, comfortable bedroom.

âOne morning I was down at the Union Depot when a farmer drove up a
big Norman hoss hitched to a surrey. Some oâ the other kids joshed
him, called the hoss an elephant and asked where the rest oâ the show
was. The man was big, well fed, and comfortable lookinâ, same as the
hoss, and he didnât pay any heed to the kids except to call one of âem
up to hold the hoss while he went into the depot. The kid wanted to
know first what he was goinâ to be paid, and he haggled so long âat
the farmer beckoned to me to come up. âWill you hold my hoss for me a
few minutes?â he asked.

âThat big gray hoss with the dark, gentle eyes seemed to me one of the
most beautiful things I had ever seen, and I was mighty anxious to
have charge of him, even for a few minutes; so I sez, âYou bet I
will.â

âThe other kids roasted me and made all manner oâ sport; but they knew
I would fight âem if they got too superfluous, so after a bit they
went on about their business. Theâs somethinâ about manâs love for a
hoss thatâs a little hard to understand. I had never had no intimate
dealinâs with one before, yet somethinâ inside me reached out and
entwined itself all about this big, gray, velvet-nosed beauty left in
my charge. I reckon it must be in a manâs blood; thatâs the only
explanation I can find. All the way back along the trail oâ history we
find the bones of men and hosses bleachinâ together in the same heap;
and about every worthwhile spot on the face oâ nature has been fought
over on hossback, so itâs small wonder if the feel of a hoss has got
to be part of manâs nature.

âThe farmer had had a woman and a little girl in his care, to see off
on the train, and he was gone some time. I had a few pennies in my
pocket, and I bought an apple anâ fed it to the hoss, gettinâ more
enjoyment out of it than out of airy other apple Iâd ever owned. I can
feel right now the strange movinâs inside my breast as his moist nose
sniffed at my fingers and his delicate lips picked up the bits of
apple, as careful anâ gentle as though my rough, dirty little hand had
been made oâ crystal.

âI was so interested in the hoss that I gave a start of surprise when
the farmerâs voice behind me sez: âYou seem to like hosses, son.â

ââI hadnât no idee âat a great big one like this could be so smooth
anâ gentle,â I said, with my hand rubbinâ along the hossâs throat. âI
think heâs a wonder.â

ââDo you like other animals?â asked the farmer.

ââI reckon I must be an animal myself,â sez I, âbecause I allus get
along well with them, while I have to fight a lot with humans.â

ââWhat do you want for tendinâ to this hoss?â he asked me.

ââI donât want nothinâ,â sez I. âWeâve got to be friends, anâ I donât
charge nothinâ for doinâ favors for a friend. Besides, heâs got so
much sense, I doubt if he needs much watchinâ.â

âThe farmer grinned, looked into my eyes a long time, and gave me a
dollar. âNow tell me how youâll spend your dollar,â sez he.

âWell, I was purty well floored. I had never owned a dollar before in
my whole life, my father havinâ taken away every cent he had ever
found on me; and I stood lookinâ at the coin, and hardly knowinâ what
to do. The farmer stood lookinâ down at me with his eyes twinklinâ,
and after a minute, I handed the dollar back to him. âThis is too
much,â I sez. âA dime would be plenty for the job, even if I didnât
like the hoss; but if my old man would find a dollar on me, heâd give
me a beatinâ for hidinâ it from him, take it away, get drunk, and then
give me another beatinâ for not havinâ another dollar.â

âSo he asked me all about my father; and I told about him and about my
mother beinâ dead, and the twinkle left his eyes and they grew moist,
so âat he had to wink mighty fast.

âHe told me that his own boy was dead and his girl married, and that
theâ wasnât any children out at the big farm, and asked me if I
wouldnât like to come and live with him. He told me about all the
hosses anâ the cows anâ the pigs, anâ that I could have a clean little
room to sleep in, anâ plenty oâ food and clothes, and could go to
school. It sounded like a fairy tale to me, and I sez, âAw go on,
youâre just joshinâ meâ; but he meant it; so I got on the seat beside
him, and as soon as we got out oâ town he let me drive the big gray
hossâand I entered into a real world more wonderful than any fairy
tale ever was.

âWhen we drove up the shady lane and into the big barn lot, a little
old lady with sad eyes came to the door, and sez: âNow, John, who is
that with you?â and my heart sank, for I thought she wasnât goinâ to
stand for me; but he took me by the hand and led me up to the door,
put his arm about the little womanâs shoulder, and sez with a tremble
in his voice: âThis here is a little feller Iâve brought out to be
company for ya, mother. He hasnât any folks, and he is fond of
animals, and, andâhis name is John, too.â

âAt first she shook her head and shut her lips tight; but all of a
sudden the tears came to her eyes, and she put her arms about meâand
I had found a real home.

âThose were wonderful years, Happy, wonderful; and I have the
satisfaction oâ knowinâ that I did them about as much good as they did
me. Their hearts had been wrapped up in the boy, and he must have been
a fine feller; but just when he had been promoted out oâ the grammar
grade at the head of his class, he had took the scarlet fever anâ
died. I wasnât used to kindness when I went there; so I never noticed
âat they kept me out oâ the inner circle oâ their hearts at first. I
called the little woman Mrs. Carmichael for some time; but one day
after Iâd brought home a good report from school, I called her this,
and she spoke to me sharpâI never knew any soft-hearted person in the
world who got so much solid satisfaction out of actinâ cross as she
did. Well, she spoke to me sharp, and sez: âJohn Carmichael, why donât
you call me Mother?â

âI looked into her face, and it didnât look old any longer, and the
sad look had left her eyes, and they were black and snappy anâ full oâ
life; so I tried it; and we both broke into tears, but they were tears
oâ joy; and then he insisted that I call him Dad, and we became a
family; and about the happiest one in the world, I reckon.

âI rode the hosses bareback, shot hawks with my rifle, picked berries,
did a lot oâ chores, and worked hard with my books. It was a full,
round life with lots of love and happiness in it, and I grew, body and
mind and spirit, as free and natural as the big oak trees in the woods
pasture.

âMr. Carmichael had looked up my blood father and had done what he
could for him; but it was no use, and one winterâs morning he was
found frozen in an alley. I didnât learn of it until the next June
when he took me down to the city cemetery where my father and mother
lay side by side. I did feel downcast as we all do in the presence of
death; but it wasnât my real father and mother who were lyinâ there
beneath the quiet mounds. Fatherhood and motherhood are somethinâ more
than mere physical processes. The real fathers and mothers are those
who put the best part oâ their lives into makinâ the big, gloomy world
into a tender home for _all_ the little ones; and after my visit
to the graveyard I felt drawn even closer to Dad and Mother than I had
before.

âChildren ought to have dogs and hosses and plenty of air and soil
about âem, Happy. We donât learn from preachinâ, we learn from
example; and we can learn a heap from the animals. We talk about our
sanitary systems; but we allus mean the sanitary systems outside our
bodies. Now, the animals have sanitary systems, but they are inside
their own skins, where they rightly belong. Look at the beautiful
teeth of a dogâThese come from eatinâ proper food at the proper time
and in proper quantities. If a dog isnât hungry, the dog wonât eat. If
a child isnât hungry, it is fed candy in a lot oâ cases, and this is
downright wicked. Of course the animals find it hard to live, crowded
up the way man allus fixes things; but as a rule animals are temperate
and clean, patient and honest, wise and strong; and I wish weâd use
âem more as instructors for the young. Most mothers think a dogâs
tongue is dirtyâWhy, a dogâs tongue is chemically clean, and healinâ
in its action; while the human mouth is generally poisonousâask a
dentist.

âAnd a cowâs breath, after she has rolled in with sweetly solemn
dignity from the clover fieldâAh, thatâs a pleasant memory! Iâll
venture to say âat mighty few monarchs have been as worthy oâ beinâ
kissed before breakfast, as Nebukaneezer was while he was undergoinâ
punishment for his sins. I had gone to that farm with my soul all
stunted and gnarly; but it straightened out and shot its little stems
up toward the blue, the same as the stalks oâ corn did.

âAll I had as a start was a love of animals; and this is why I allus
try to find the one soft spot in a manâs natureâEven if itâs a secret
vice, it is something to work on. This is what makes such a problem of
Tyrrel Jones. I canât find out a single soft place in him; but Iâm
goinâ to get into the heart of him yet, if I can find the way.

âWell, Dad and Mother passed away within a week of each other a short
time after I had been graduated. I had made up my mind to stay on the
farm with âem as long as they stayed; although all sorts of voices
were callinâ to me from the big outer world; but their daughter lived
in the city, and had been weaned away from the farm, so she sold it,
and I started on my pilgrimage.

âThey had left me an income of three hundred and fifty dollars a year;
and I determined to go to college. When I thought of how rich and full
my own life had been made, after its stunted beginning, I wanted to do
all I could to make the whole earth like that farm had been, and it
seemed to me that the best way was to become a priest of the Lord. I
tried my best; but I have been considâable of a failure, Happy. Now, I
hardly know where I stand. I am sort of an outcast now, and just doing
what seems best on my own hook.

âA lot of my ideals have been lost, a lot of my hopes have faded, a
lot of my work has seemed like sweeping back the waves of the sea; but
for all I have lost, new things have taken their place, and I have
never lost my faith in the Lord. Now, I am weak in doctrine and a
stranger to dogma; and the things for which I fight with all my soul
and heart and strength, are kindliness and decency.

âAs long as one beinâ in the world is cold or hungry or diseased,
every other beinâ is liable to become hungry and cold and diseased.
What I am fighting for is a world without poverty. Most oâ the ills of
life spring from poverty, and poverty is the result of selfishness and
greed. The earth is reeking with riches, but its bounty is not divided
fairly.

âHappy, if I could only hold up the Lord, so that all men might see
the beauty and fullness of Him, the glory and grandeur of His simple
life and His majestic self-sacrifice, the fleeting cheapness of
material things would sink to their real value, and we would all
become one great family, workinâ together in peace and contentment.
Now, go on to sleep.â

It was purty late by this time sure enough, and I fell asleep soon
after this; but I awakened durinâ the night and found myself alone. It
was cold when I stuck my nose out from under the tarp, but it was a
wonderful night, clear and still, with the stars swinginâ big and
bright just above my reach.

As I lay there, I heard Friar Tuck singinâ softly to himself out where
the trail dipped down into the valley:

    âThe night is dark, and I am far from home,
        Lead Thou me on!
    Keep Thou my feet: I do not ask to see
    The distant scene,âone step enough for me.â

I had never heard his voice so wonderfully beautiful before; but, my
stars, the sadness of it made me choke! It wasnât just a song, it was
a cry; and I knew that it came from a lonely, bleedinâ heart. I put my
head under the covers again, puzzlinâ over what was on his mind; but
first thing I knew I was awakened by the glad voice of the old Friar
Tuck, singinâ his favorite morninâ hymn: âBrightest and best of the
sons of the morningâ; so I cooked breakfast, and he went his way, and
I went mine.




CHAPTER SEVEN

HORACE WALPOLE BRADFORD


The Diamond Dot, while it was about the idealest ranch in the West
from most standpoints, was run a little loose. Jabez didnât have any
luxurious tastes, and he wasnât miserly; so he didnât strain things
down to the last pennyânot by a whole lot. All he asked was to have
his own way and be comfortable; and so he allus kept more punchers ân
he had actual need of, and unless they got jubilant over imposinâ on
him, he just shut his eyes and grinned about it.

Takinâ his location and outfit into account, and he just simply
couldnât help but make money; so we all had a fairly easy time of it
and grew tender feelinâs, the same as spoiled children; which is why
we sometimes quit, for we never had any other excuse for it.

Barbie was a notice-takinâ child, if ever theâ was one; and she stood
out for company as a general and standinâ order. Company didnât affect
olâ Cast Steel one way or the other; they were just the same to him as
a couple oâ hundred head oâ ponies, more or less; and so the news got
out that we allus had a lot of extra beds made up and any one was
welcome to stretch out in âem who wanted to. The result oâ this was,
âat we drew visitors as easy as molasses draws flies. I lived at the
home house on account oâ beinâ Barbieâs pal, and so I got into the
habit oâ beinâ a sort of permanent reception committee. Some oâ these
visitors was a plague to me; but Jabez didnât like to run any risk of
havinâ âem ruined beyond repair, so it was generally understood that I
had to use ex-treme caution when I started in to file the clutch off
their welcome.

This spring âat I have in mind, we had as visitor one oâ the
easternest dudes I was ever tangled up with. He came out for his
health, which is the excuse most of âem gives; but this one took more
ways of avoidinâ health ân airy other of âem I ever saw. He smoked
cigars all day long, big black ones, strong enough to run a sawmill,
he ate fatteninâ food from morninâ till night, and when he drove out
in the buckboard to take his exercise, he suffered from what he called
fatigue. He used to sit up as wide awake as an owl till along about
ten every night; and half the time he didnât crawl out until near
seven in the morninâ. He certainly was a pest!

What he complained of most, was his nerves; and heâd sit for hours,
talkinâ about âem to anything âat had ears. He said the worst of it
was, he couldnât sleep nights. I had, of course, heard oâ nerves
before ever I saw him; but I had never heard of âem turninâ to and
devilinâ a man, the way his did; so at first I was honestly
interested, and asked him all I could think up about âem; but after a
day or so, Iâd âaâ been perfectly willinâ to put up the coin out oâ my
own pocket to have him go to a dentist and have every last one of his
nerves pulled.

I donât begrudge sympathy to any afflicted individual; but the more I
sympathized with this feller, the more affectionate toward me he got;
and he used to trot about after me, warbilinâ out dirges about his
nerves until I was tempted to tie a stone around his neck and lose him
down the cistern.

He ran to language, too, this one did. His conversation was so full of
it that a feller could scarcely understand what he was tryinâ to say.
He was ferociously interested in the ancient Greeks; and if a man
succeeded in wedginâ him away from his nerves, he began immediate to
discourse about these ancient Greeks. Now, I didnât have a single
thing againâ any oâ these ancient Greeks before this Dude struck us,
none of âem ever havinâ crossed my trail before; but they sure did
have a rotten outfit oâ names, and they were the most infernal liars
âat ever existed. Three-headed dogs, and women with snakes for hair,
were as common in their tales as thieves among the Sioux. Barbie
didnât have any use for this Eastener either; so I decided to fit him
out with a deep-rooted desire for home influences.

I took olâ Tank Williams into my confidence, he beinâ the most
gruesome lookinâ creature we had in our parts. He was a big man of
curious construction and he had one eye which ran wild. Tank never
knew what this free eye was up to; and while he would be examininâ the
ground, the free eye would be gazinâ up at a tree as intent as though
he had set it to watch for a crow. Durinâ his younger days, Tank had
formed the habit of indulginâ in gang fights as much as possible, and
all of his features had been stampeded out oâ their natural orbits;
but this free eye beat anything I ever see.

They had him down on his back one time, and he was gnawinâ away
contentedly at some fellerâs thumb, when the feller reached up his
trigger finger and scooped out Tankâs eye. The shape and color werenât
hurt a bit; but some oâ the workinâ parts got disconnected, so that he
couldnât see with it; but it appeared to be full as good an eye as the
one he looked with.

All the sleep Tank ever wanted was six hours out oâ the twenty-four,
and he didnât care how he got âemâten minutes at a time, or all in
one lump. He could sleep sittinâ up straight, or ridinâ, or stretched
out in bed, or most any way. I think he could sleep while walkin,â
though I was never able to surprise him at it. He agreed to back me
up, and Spider Kelley also said he was willinâ to do everything in his
power to furnish our guest some pleasant recollections after heâd gone
back to a groove which fitted him better.

As soon as I began to plan my trip, I started to rehearse curious
secrets about Tank to the Eastener, whose name was Horace Walpole
Bradford. I told Horace that Tank had a case oâ nerves which made his
ân seem like a bundle of old shoe-laces; and that if something wasnât
done for him soon, I feared he was goinâ to develop insanity. I said
that even now, it wasnât safe to contrary him none, and that Iâd be a
heap easier in my own mind if Tank was coralled up in a cell
somewhere, with irons on.

I didnât tell Tank what sort of a disposition I was supplyinâ him with
for fear heâd overdo it. Tank didnât know a nerve from an ingrowinâ
hair; but when he and Horace paired off to tell each other their
symptoms, Iâll have to own up that his tales of anguish anâ sufferinâ
made Horaceâs troubles sound like dance music.

I told Horace that a trip through the mountains would soothe and
invigorate him, until heâd be able to sleep, hanginâ by his toes like
a bat; but the trouble was to find something which interested him
enough to lure him on the trip. There was a patent medicine almanac at
the place, and I studied up its learninâ until I had it at my tongueâs
end, and I also used a lot oâ Friar Tuckâs health theories; so that I
got Horace interested enough to talk my eardrums callous; but not
enough to take the trip.

I didnât know much about nerves; but I was as familiar with sleep as
though I had graduated from eleven medical colleges, and I knew if he
would just follow my directions, it would give him such an appetite
for slumber that heâd drop into it without rememberinâ to close his
eyelids. Olâ Jabez happened to mention an Injun buryinâ ground with
the members reposinâ on top oâ pole scaffolds, and this proved to be
the bait. Horace wanted to see this, and it was a four daysâ drive by
buckboard; so I heaved a sigh oâ relief and prepared to do my duty.

When all was ready, we packed our stuff in the good buckboard, putting
in an extra saddle for the accident we felt sure was goinâ to happen.
Spider started as driver, while I rode behind, leadinâ a horse with
Tankâs saddle on, though Horace thought it was Spiderâs. We had told
him that it made our backs ache to ride in a buckboard all day, so we
would change off once in a while. Horace wanted to do the drivinâ
himself; but we pointed out that he wasnât used to our kind oâ roads,
and consequently favored the little hills too much. He was inhumanly
innocent, and it was almost like feedinâ a baby chalk and water.

We trotted along gentle, until the rear spring came loose goinâ down a
little dip to a dry crick bed, about ten miles out. We talked it over
and decided âat the best plan would be for Spider to drive back and
get the old buckboard; so after unloadinâ our stuff, I took the tap
out oâ my pocket, fixed the spring, tied a rope about it to deceive
Horace, and Spider drove back for the old buckboard which had been
discarded years before, but which we had fixed up for this trip and
painted until it looked almost safe to use.

Before long we saw the buckboard cominâ back; but much to our
surprise, Tank Williams was drivinâ it, anâ givinâ what he thought was
the imitation of a nervous man. He would stand up anâ yell, crack his
mule-skinner, and send the ponies along on a dead run. He came up to
us, and said that he had had an attack oâ nerves, hadnât slept a wink
the night before; and when Spider Kelley had refused to let him go in
his place, he had torn him from the seat anâ had trampled him.

âI trampled him,â sez Tank solemnly, his free eye lookinâ straight
into the sun. âI hope I didnât destroy him; but in my frenzy I
trampled him.â

Horace looked worried. âTank,â sez I soothinâly, âwe donât really need
any one else along. You just help us to load, anâ then go back, like a
good feller.â

Tank stood up on the seat, anâ held the whip ready. âMy life depends
on me takinâ this trip!â he yelled. âMy life depends on it; it depends
on it, I tell you. My life depends on me takinâ this trip!â

He went on repeatinâ about his life dependinâ on his takinâ that trip,
until I made a sign to Horace, and said âat weâd better let him go
along. Horace wasnât ambitious to be trampled; so he concluded to
concur, anâ climbed into the seat beside Tank. Any one else would âaâ
noticed that it was Tankâs saddle on the hoss I was leadinâ; but
Horace never noticed anything which wasnât directly connected with his
own body. He didnât even have any idee that the sun had set habits in
the matter oâ risinâ anâ settinââwhich was another fact I had took
into account.

We were drivinâ four broncs to the buckboard, anâ they was new to the
game and in high spirits. Tank was also in high spirits, anâ we went
at a clip which was inspirinâ, even to sound nerves. We did our level
best to give Horace somethinâ real to worry about, anâ from the very
start his nerves was so busy handinâ in idees anâ sensations that his
mind was took up with these instead of with the nerves themselves as
was usual.

Well, we sure had a delightful ride that afternoon: every time âat
Horace would beseech Tank to be more careful in swinginâ around
down-hill curves, Tank would seize him by the arm with his full
squeezinâ grip, anâ moan: âItâs my nerves, my pore nerves. This is one
oâ the times when Iâm restive, I got to have action; my very life
depends on it! Whoop, hit âem upâWhee!â anâ heâd crack his
mule-skinner about the ears oâ the ponies, anâ weâd have another
runaway for a spell.

Horace hadnât the mite of an idee in which direction he was travelinâ;
all he did was to hang on and hope. The confounded buckboard was
tougher ân we had figured on, and it didnât bust until near dark. As
they went up the slope, I could see the left hind wheel weavinâ purty
rapid, anâ as they tore down the grade to Cottonwood Crick, things
began to creak anâ rattle most threateninâ. We had decided to camp on
the crick, anâ Tank swung up his team with a flourish. The hind wheel
couldnât stand the strain, anâ when it crumbled, Horace, anâ the rest
oâ the baggage, whip-crackered off like a pinwheel. Of course when one
wheel went, the others dished in company, anâ the whole thing was a
wreck.

The ponies were comfortable weary, anâ after I had roped one anâ the
rest had fallen over him, we soothed âem down without much trouble,
anâ started to make camp. Horace was all in, anâ was minded to sit on
his shoulder blades anâ rest; but this wasnât part oâ the plan, anâ we
made him hustle like a new camp-boy. As soon as supper was over, he
lit a cigar, anâ prepared to take a rest. We had decided that those
big, black cigars wasnât best for his nerves, so we had smuggled out
the box, anâ had worked a little sulphur into all but the top row. He
lit his cigar and gave us one apiece, but he was so sleepy he couldnât
keep his on fire; and it was comical to watch him.

Every time heâd nod off, Tank would utter an exclamation, anâ walk up
anâ down, rubbinâ his hands anâ cussinâ about his nerves. Horace was
dead tired from beinâ jounced about on the buckboard all day; but he
was worried about Tank, anâ this would wake him effectual.

About ten oâclock I sez: âTank, what happened that night when you got
nervous up in the Spider Water country?â

âOh, donât ask me, donât ask me,â sez Tank, gittinâ up anâ walkinâ off
into the darkness.

âI wish to glory he hadnât come along,â I sez to Horace. âI fear weâre
goinâ to have trouble; but chances are that a good nightâs restâll
quiet him, all right.â

Purty soon Tank came back, lit his pipe, anâ sat facinâ Horace with
his lookinâ eye, anâ everything else in the landscape with his free
one. âYou know how it is with nerves,â he sez to Horace. âYou perhaps,
of all them I have ever met up with, know how strained and twisted
nerves fill a manâs heart with murder, set his teeth on edge and put
the taste of blood in his throat; so Iâm goinâ to tell the whole oâ
that horrid experience, which I have never yet confided to a livinâ
soul before. Have you got a match?â

Tankâs pipe allus went out at the most interestinâ times; and he
couldnât no wise talk without smokinâ. We all knew this; so whenever
Tank got headed away on a tale, we heaved questions at him, just to
see how many matches we could make him burn. Heâd light a match and
hold it to his pipe; but he allus lit off an idee with the match, and
when heâd speak out the idee, heâd blow out the match. Or else heâd be
so took up by his own talkinâ, heâd hold the match until it burnt his
fingers; then, without shuttinâ off his discourse, heâd moisten the
fingers on his other hand, take the burnt end of the match careful,
and hold it until it was plumb burnt up, without ever puttinâ it to
his pipe. I didnât want to waste matches on this trip so I told Horace
to hand Tank his cigar. Horace had already wasted two cigars, besides
the ones he had given us; and I wanted him to get to the sulphur ones
as soon as convenient.

Tankâs mind was preoccupied with the tale we had made up; so he took
Horaceâs fresh cigar, lit his pipe by it, threw the cigar into the
fire, and said moodily: âHe was unobliginâ. Yes, that cross-grained
old miner was unobliginâ. Of course, I wouldnât have done it if I
hadnât been nervous; but I say now, as Iâve allus thought, that he
brought it on himself by beinâ unobliginâ.â

Tankâs gloomy tones had wakened Horace up complete; and as he started
to light another cigar, I got ready for bed. âYou two have already got
nerves,â I sez to âem; âbut I donât want to catch âem, so Iâll sleep
alone, and you can bunk together.â I unrolled my tarp close to the
fire and crawled into it, intendinâ to take my rest while I listened
to Tank unfold his story.

It was a clean, fresh night, just right for sleepinâ; and it almost
seemed a shame to put that innocent little Eastener through his
treatment; but it was for his own good so I stretched out with a sigh
oâ content, and looked at the other two by the fire.

Horace was short and fat around the middle with stringy arms and legs.
He wore some stuff he called side-burns on his face. They started up
by his ears, curved along his jaws and were fastened to the ends of
his stubby mustache. He kept âem cropped short and, truth to tell,
they were an evil-lookinâ disfigurement, though he didnât seem to feel
a mite oâ shame at wearinâ âem. His face was full oâ trouble, and yet
he was so sleepy he had to hitch his eyebrows clear up to his hair to
keep his eyes open. Tankâs face never did have what could rightly be
called expressions. His features used to fall into different kinds oâ
convulsions; but they were so mussed up it was impossible to read âem.
I looked at these two a minute, and then I had to pull my head under
the tarp to keep from laughinâ.




CHAPTER EIGHT

A CASE OF NERVES


âI was all alone,â sez Tank. âI had been up in the Spider Water
country lookinâ for a favorite ridinâ pony; but my hoss broke a leg,
and I packed my saddle and stuff on my head until my nerves began to
swell. Then I threw the stuff away and hunted for a human. I roamed
for weeks without cominâ across a white man, and my nerves got worse
anâ worse. You know how it is with nerves; how they set up that dull
ache along the back oâ your spinal cord until you get desperate, and
long to bite and scratch and tear your feller-beinâs to piecesâwell,
I had âem worse this time ân ever I had âem before; and they loosened
up my brain-cells until my self-control oozed out and I longed to
fling myself over a cliff. Have you got a match?â

Horace passed over his fresh cigar, and Tank lit his pipe and tossed
this cigar into the fire also. Horace looked at it sadly for a moment;
but he was game, and lit another.

âFinally,â sez Tank, âI came upon a lonely cabin at the bottom of a
gorge; and in it was a little man who was mininâ for gold. He was
about your build, except that toilinâ with pick and shovel had
distributed his meat around to a better advantage, and he wore his
whiskers complete, without any patch scraped off the chin. It was just
night when I reached the cabin, and he invited me in to eat; which I
am free to say I did until I was stuffed up to my swaller, and then we
prepared to sleep.

âNow, a feller would nachely think Iâd âaâ gone right to sleep; but
instead oâ this, my nerves began to twist anâ squirm anâ gnaw at me
until I was almost beside myself; and after fightinâ it for several
hours, I woke up the miner, and asked him as polite as a lady, if he
wouldnât rub my brow for a few minutes. Seems like when Iâm nervous,
theâ wonât nothinâ soothe me so quick as to have my brow rubbed; but
this little coyote refused pointblank to do it.

âI finally got down on my knees and begged him to; but he still
refused. He said he had fed me six meals at once and given me shelter,
and this was as far as heâd go if my confounded nerves exploded and
blew the place up. I was meek about it, I tried my best to ward off
trouble; but just then a nerve up under my ear gave a wrench which
twisted me all out oâ shape, and I lost patience. I seized that little
cuss by the beard and I yanked him out on the floor, and I said to
himââ

Tank had once been unusual gifted in framinâ up bright-colored
profanity, but he had been shuttinâ down on it since the night he had
helped to fake the hold-up on the Friar, and I thought he had lost the
knack. This night, though, he seemed to find a spiritual uplift in
tellinâ to Horace exactly what he had said to the lonely miner. Before
he finished this part, he had used up all of Horaceâs good cigars, as
lighters, and the Eastenerâs face had turned a palish blue. Iâd be
willinâ to bet that Tank made the swearinâ record that night; though
of course, theâ ainât any way to prove it.

When Tank couldnât think of any new combinations, he covered his face
and broke into tears. Horace sat and looked at him with his eyes
poppinâ out. âDonât you think you could go to sleep?â he asked after a
bit.

âSleep!â yelled Tank. âSleep? I doubt if I ever do sleep again. I feel
worse right now ân I did that night in the gorge.â

âWhat did you finally do that time?â asked Horace.

âI hate to think of it,â sez Tank; and he put his elbows on his knees,
his chin in his hands, and stared into the fire as though seeinâ
ghosts.

Horace watched him a while, and then he lit a cigar out of the second
layer. He took one puff and then removed the cigar and stared at it.
He tried another puff, and then threw it into the fire, where it
spluttered up in a blue flame. He tried six more, and then said
somethinâ I couldnât quite catch and threw the whole box into the
fire; while Tank continued to stare into it as though he had forgot
theâ was any one else on earth.

âLetâs go to bed,â sez Horace.

âHave you got a match?â sez Tank, lookinâ around with a start. Horace
took a burninâ stick from the fire, and Tank lit his pipe with it; and
from that on Horace kept a lighted stick handy.

âHow in thunder did you get to sleep that night in the gorge?â
demanded Horace, who was gettinâ impatient.

âWell,â sez Tank, âafter I had told this unobliginâ little cuss
exactly what I thought of him, he pulled out a gun and tried to shoot
meâactually tried to shoot me in his own cabin, where I was his
guest. My feelinâs were hurt worse ân theyâd ever been hurt before;
but still I tried to calm myself; and if it hadnât been for my nerves,
Iâd have gone out into that gorge in the dead oâ night, and never set
eyes on his evil face again; but I couldnât get control of myself, so
I took his gun away from him and knocked him down with it. When he
regained consciousness, he was in a repentant mood; and he consented
to rub my head.

âHe rubbed my head a while anâ I sank into a dreamless, health-given
repose; but as soon as I was asleep, the traitorious sneak crept out
anâ started to run. I fled after him as swift as I could, anâ caught
him about two A. M. I had to twist his arms to make him come back with
me; but when I had once got him back to the shack, I tied him good anâ
tight, anâ made him rub my brow again. When heâd rub slow anâ gentle,
Iâd sleep peaceful anâ quiet; but the minute heâd quit, why, Iâd wake
up again; so he rubbed anâ rubbed anâ rubbedââTank smoothed his left
hand gentle with his right, anâ spoke slow anâ whisperyââanâ I slept
anâ slept anâ slept anâââ

The darn cuss said it so soothinâ anâ natural, that hanged if I didnât
fall asleep myself, though the last I remember, I was bitinâ my lips
so I could stay awake anâ see the fun. I must have been asleep full an
hour before I was woke up by Tankâs voice, raised in anger. I stuck my
nose out oâ the tarp, anâ there was Tank kneelinâ straddle oâ the
other bed which he had rolled up in the shape of a man. Horace was
standinâ close by with his hands on his hips anâ lookinâ altogether
droopy.

âI raised his head from the floor, like this,â said Tank, illustratinâ
with the bed, âanâ then I beat it down on the planks oâ the floor; anâ
then I raised it up again, anâ then I beat it down, anâ then I raised
it upââ

I had to stuff a corner oâ the soogan into my mouth to keep from
laughinâ out loud at the expression in Horaceâs eyes; but Tank kept
raisinâ that poor head anâ beatinâ it down again for so long that I
fell asleep again without intendinâ to.

The next time I woke up Horace was speakinâ. He was so earnest about
it that at first I thought he had been weepinâ; but he was simply
tryinâ to make his voice winninâ anâ persuadish.

âIâll rub it,â he sez. âIâll rub it soft anâ gentle, just like you say
you want it rubbed. Come on, let me rub it.â I looked at Tank with his
free eye rollinâ about as though it was follerinâ the antics of a
delirious mosquito; and Iâd just about as soon have rubbed the brow of
a porcupine; but Horace was all perked up with sympathy.

âNo,â sez Tank, sadly. âYouâre a guest, anâ it wouldnât be polite. If
you was a stranger, now, why, Iâd choke your heart out but what I made
you rub it; but not a guest. No, I couldnât do that. Iâd wake Happy up
anâ make him rub it; but he allus sleeps with a gun under his head,
anâ heâs apt to shoot before heâs full awake.â

âWell, just let me try it a while,â sez Horace.

âIâm feared to,â sez Tank, beginninâ to weaken. âIf you was to start,
anâ I was to fall asleep, anâ you was to quit, I might dream âat you
was that unobliginâ man which betrayed me back in the lonely shack;
anâ I might strangle you or somethinâ before I came to my senses.
Nope, the best plan is just to sit anâ chat here till daylight. My
nerves is allus better after sun-up.â

âI donât think I can stay awake much longer,â sez Horace, almost
whimperinâ.

âWhat?â sez Tank in surprise. âYou claim to have nerves, anâ yet you
can talk oâ fallinâ asleep at this time oâ night. Great Scott, man,
you ainât got no nerves! You are as flebmatic as a horn toad. Oh, I
wish I could just fall sleepy for one minute.â

âLet me try rubbinâ your brow,â sez Horace, whose eyes were blinkinâ
for sleep, but whose face was all screwed up into lines of worry at
what was goinâ to happen to him after he had finally give in anâ
drifted off.

âWell,â sez Tank, âIâll let you try; but if youâre already sleepy, I
doubt if any good comes of it. You sit there at the head oâ the bed,
anâ Iâll lay my head in your lap, anâ you rub my brow soft anâ gentle.
If I do get to sleepinâ natural, why oâ course theâ wonât be no harm
done in you takinâ a few winks; but for the love oâ peace, donât sleep
sound.â

I blame near choked while they were gettinâ settled, âcause Horace was
one oâ those finicky cusses, anâ Tankâs head looked like a moth-eaten
buffalo robe. Finally, however, Tank stretched out with the covers up
around his neck anâ his head pillowed in Horaceâs lap, and then Horace
began to rub his brow as soft anâ gentle as he knew how.

âYou donât do it clingy enough,â sez Tank. âYou want to just rest your
fingers lightly, but still have âem draw along so âat theyâll give a
little tingle. There, thatâs better. Now then, Iâll lay as quiet as I
can, anâ try to go to sleep.â Tank was doinâ such an earnest job, he
had plumb fooled himself into believinâ it was mostly true.

He gave a start after layinâ quiet for five or ten minutes, anâ this
put Horace on edge again; but Tank didnât wake up. Horace had a saddle
blanket around his shoulders; and the last I saw just before I fell
asleep, myself, was Horace gently rubbinâ Tankâs brow, anâ lookinâ
down careful for a change of expression. They made a curious sight
with the firelight back of âem.

It was grayinâ up for the dawn next time I woke up; and Iâd had my
sleep out, but when I stuck my nose out from under the tarp, I found
it purty tolâable frosty. I knew it was my duty to roust out anâ keep
Horace from gettinâ more sleep ân my treatment for his nerves called
for; but I was too comfortable, to pay much heed to the still, small
voice of duty. At the same time I was curious to see what my boon
comrades was up to, so I stretched my neck anâ took a look at âem.

Horace had keeled over so that his elbow rested on Tankâs chest anâ
his head rested on his hand; but the other hand was still on Tankâs
brow, anâ I reckon Horace must have rubbed until he didnât care
whether it was sleep or death he drew, just so he got rid oâ keepinâ
awake. Tank had reached up one hand so it circled Horaceâs waist; and
they made the most lovable group a body ever see.

While I was still watchinâ âem, Horaceâs arm gave out, anâ he settled
down on top oâ Tankâs nose. In about two minutes Tank came to with a
jump, anâ heaved Horace to the foot of the bed. Tank was really
startled, anâ he came to his feet glarinâ. âYou blame little squab,
you!â he yelled. âWhat are you tryinâ to doâsmother me?â

Horace staggered to his feet, but he couldnât get his eyes open more
ân a narrow slit. âI didnât do it on purpose, Mr. Williams,â he
blubbled like a drunk man. âI rubbed until I thought my hand would
fall off at the wrist; but I reckon I must âaâ dropped asleep. Lie
down again, anâ Iâll rub you some more.â

âToo late,â sez Tank, âtoo late, too late. I never can sleep while
daylightâs burninâ; but still, my nerves donât get so dangerous until
after nightfall; so weâll just turn to anâ get breakfast.â

Well, I got up after yawninâ a few times; and after askinâ if they had
had a restful night, I started to get breakfast. Horace staggered
about, gettinâ wood anâ water anâ doinâ what he was able to, while
Tank wrangled in the hosses.

After breakfast, which I must say for Horace, he et in able shape, we
started to saddle up, puttinâ the spare saddle on the hoss I had rode
the day before. âWhich one oâ you is goinâ back after the other
buckboard?â asked Horace.

âWhy, we ainât goinâ back at all,â sez I. âItâs full fifty miles, anâ
we canât keep switchinâ buckboards every day on a trip like this.
Weâll just ride the ponies the rest oâ the way.â

âRide?â sez Horace. âRide!â




CHAPTER NINE

TREATING THE CASE


Horace started to enlarge on how much he didnât know about ridinâ; but
Tank breaks in with a plea for his nerves. âLook here,â he said,
scowlinâ at Horace with his good eye, while the free one rove around
wild in his face, âyour nerves are a little out oâ fix, anâ mine is
plumb tied into knots. This here outinâ will be the best thing we can
do for ourselves, anâ you got to come along. No matter which way you
go, you got to ride; so theâ ainât no sense in makinâ a fuss about it.
Weâll mount you up on as gentle a cayuse as theâ is in the West; anâ
we wonât tell no one if you hang on to the saddle horn goinâ down
hill.â

âThatâs right, Mr. Bradford,â sez I respectful. âYouâd have to ride
back anyway, so you might as well come on with us anâ have a pleasant
outing.â

âBesides,â sez Tank, âup there in the Wind River country we stand a
chance oâ gettinâ somethinâ for our nerves, if the Injuns happen to be
in a good humor. Those Injun doctors know all about hurbs anâ which
diseases they grow for, anâ when theyâre in a good humor, theyâll sell
ya some.â

âWhatâll they do if theyâre not in a good humor?â asked Horace.

âWell, thatâs the beatinâest question Iâve yet heard!â sez Tank. âHow
does any one know what an Injunâll do when heâs not in a good humor? I
donât reckon any one ever tried to learn the answer to that question.
When an Injunâs not in a good humor, either youâve got to kill him or
heâll kill you. If we hear tell âat theyâre out oâ humor, weâll simply
scurry back at the first hint, anâ donât you forget it.â

Horace wasnât resigned yet; so he kept sawinâ away with his questions
all the time we were tyinâ on the beds anâ grub. The grass had been
purty brown down below, but it was fat anâ green up above, anâ the
ponies felt fine. We had picked out good ones, anâ it took some time
to get âem wore down to where they was willinâ to pack; but by seven
oâclock we were ready to start, anâ then Tank lifted Horace into the
saddle, while I held the ponyâs head. We had chose a steady old feller
for Horace, because we didnât want any serious accidents. Olâ Cast
Steel was dead againâ sheepinâ the Easteners, anâ I knew theyâd be
doinâs about what weâd done already, let alone havinâ any sort of a
mishap.

We told Horace just what to do to save himself, anâ we fixed his
stirrups to just fit him; but he took it purty hard. It takes a
ridinâ-man a couple oâ weeks to harden up after heâs laid off a spell;
but when a man begins to do his first ridinâ at forty, it comes
ex-tremely awkward. Horace was the first feller I ever saw get
sea-sick on hossback; but he certainly did have a bad attack. I
suppose it was the best thing âat could have happened to him, anâ
after he was emptied out, he rode some easier. We only covered about
thirty miles that day altogether, anâ Tank had plenty oâ time to get
all the sleep he could use; but when he came to lift Horace down from
the saddle, Horace couldnât make his legs stiff enough to stand on.

We let him stretch out while we were makinâ camp; but he fell asleep,
so we had to wake him up to help get supper. I was beginninâ to feel
sorry for him, but he had pestered us regardless about his nerves, anâ
I knew âat pity for him now would be the worse for him in the long
run.

After supper, Horace spent considâable time in bewailinâ his fate
because he had got disgusted anâ thrown his whole box oâ cigars into
the fire. âIâve got an extra pipe, if youâd like to try that,â sez
Tank. âItâs lots better for the nerves than cigarsâthough from what I
can tell oâ you, you ainât bothered much with nerves. I wish to glory
I was in your skin.â

âOh, man,â sez Horace, âyou canât imagine how I suffer. I ache like a
sore tooth all over, anâ it gives me a cute pain just to sit here on
the grass.â

âSit on the saddle-blankets,â sez Tank, sympathetic. As soon as Horace
had piled up the blankets anâ sat down on âem, groaninâ most bitter,
Tank sez with feelinâ: âGee, how I envy you. You have nothinâ but a
few muscle-aches and chafed skin anâ such, while my nerves is
beginninâ to threaten me again. Iâm not goinâ to bother either oâ you
fellers, though. Iâm goinâ to have you tie me to a tree to-night if I
canât sleep.â

Horace filled the pipe, which was an ancient one, bitter as gall; but
when he began to smoke, his face became almost satisfied. The pipe was
purty well choked up, so that he had some bother in keepinâ it goinâ,
but after weâd run a grass stem through it, it worked purty well, anâ
we was right sociable until along about nine oâclock, when I got
sleepy, myself. Then Tank began to worry about his nerves. Horace had
about forgot his own nerves, he was sufferinâ so from Tankâs.

When we see that Horace couldnât keep awake any longer without beinâ
tortured, Tank began to carry on fiercer. He rumpled up his hair, gave
starts anâ jerks, but the thing âat worked best, was just to sit anâ
look at his fingers, anâ pick at âem. Heâd form a circle with his left
thumb and forefinger, then poke his right finger through this circle
and try to grab it with his right hand before it could back out. It
was the craziest thing Iâd ever seen; but before long Horace got to
tryinâ it himself. While Tank was lookinâ at his fingers with his good
eye, the free one rambled around, anâ half the time it rested on
Horace, anâ fair gave him the creeps; but when I couldnât stay awake
myself, I gave Tank the sign, anâ he got delirious.

âI canât sleep,â he wailed, âI canât sleep! My nerves, oh, my nerves!
One minute theyâre like hot wires, anâ the next theyâre like streaks
of ice. Youâll have to tie me up, boys, you certainly will have to tie
me up.â

I argued againâ it as beinâ inhuman; but Tank begged so that finally I
gave in, anâ we tied him to a down pine tree. Horace helped to tie
him, anâ he sure did his best to make a good job of it. I was a little
doubtful, myself, about Tank gettinâ loose; but he had blowed up his
muscles, anâ he coughed me the all-right signal, so me anâ Horace
turned in.

Horace groaned considâable while stretchinâ out; but he began to snore
before I had got through findinâ the soft place. When I first go to
bed, I like to roll about a bit, anâ stretch, anâ loosen up my
musclesâI like to stay awake long enough to feel the tired spots sink
down againâ the earth, anâ sort oâ ooze into it; and before I had
drifted off, Horace was buzzinâ away at a log in great shape.

I must âaâ slept an hour when I was wakened by a bright light, anâ
lookinâ out, I saw Tank Williams standinâ with his back to the fire
anâ glowerinâ down at Horace. âAs soon as this log burns off, Iâm
goinâ to get you,â sez Tank between set teeth.

âWhat are you goinâ to get me for?â asked Horace. âYou asked me to tie
you to it. I didnât want to tie you to it, but you insisted. Iâll
untie you if you want me to, and rub your brow again.â

âItâs too late,â muttered Tank. âItâs too infernal late. Nothinâ could
put me to sleep now. As soon as this log burns off, Iâm goinâ to get
you. You was the one which brought back my nerve trouble, anâ you are
the one what has to suffer.â

Tank hadnât been able to free himself from the pine tree; so he had
dragged it in anâ across the fire. It wasnât such a big one as trees
go; but it was a mighty big one for a man, tied to it as he was, to
tote along. Horace reasoned with him a while longer, anâ then when he
saw that the trunk was about burned through, he got purty well off to
one side, anâ threw a chunk at me. I popped out of bed on the instant,
anâ began to shoot about promiscuous; so as to live up to my
reputation.

When Iâd emptied my gun, I looked at Tank, as though seeinâ him for
the first time, anâ sez: âWhat in thunder da you mean, by raisinâ all
this havoc?â

âMy nerves,â sez Tank, âmy pore nerves. I canât sleep, anâ I canât
keep my senses if Iâm left tied to this tree any longer. Itâs all his
fault, anâ as soon as this log burns up, Iâm goinâ ta hunt him down.â

Tank anâ I argued fierce as long as we could think of anything to say;
anâ just as the dead pine was gettinâ too hot for Tank to stand it any
longer, Horace calls in from the darkness, âDonât you want me to rub
your brow a while anâ see if that wonât put you to sleep?â

âCome in here,â I sez, cross. âThis man is liable to kill himself, anâ
you know more about nerves ân I do.â

Horace crawled out from behind a big rock, came in, shiverinâ with the
cold; anâ we untied Tank from the log. He had managed to get his feet
loose; but his hands had been tied behind him anâ when they got cold,
he couldnât make a go of it. âWell,â sez I, as soon as Tank was free,
âwhat are you goinâ to do now?â

âI move we get up the hosses, anâ start at once,â sez Tank. âI donât
trust myself any longer, anâ we can ride faster at night. My one hope,
is to get to an Injun doctor, or else get so tired out that I can fall
into a dreamless sleep.â

âWhy donât you ride alone?â demanded Horace with a sudden burst of
intelligence. âWhy donât you ride alone; anâ then you could ride as
fast as you wanted to, anâ if you found the Injuns out oâ humor, you
could come back anâ let us know.â

This set us back for a minute: we had been playinâ Horace for beinâ
utterly thought-loose; but he had figured out the best plan theâ was,
anâ his eyes were bright anâ eager.

âTake the hoss thatâs fastened on the rope here,â Horace went on; âanâ
we can take the manacled hosses in the morninâ and foller ya. Yes,
thatâs the best plan.â

You see the fact was, we were only twenty or twenty-five miles from
the ranch house. We had been circlinâ anâ zig-zagginâ through the
hills, anâ at night we hung up Horaceâs pony on a picket anâ put
hobbles on the balance. Beinâ fooled on direction wasnât any sign of
Horace beinâ a complete lunkhead; Iâve known a heap oâ wise ones get
balled up in the mountains.

Tank stood puzzlinâ over it with his free eye trottinâ about in a
circle; but he couldnât think any way out of it. âAll right,â sez he,
âif you two can get along without me, why, Iâll risk my life by beinâ
a scout.â

âNonsense,â sez Horace; âthe Injuns havenât riz for years, anâ theyâre
not likely to again.â

Tank only winked his lookinâ eye, anâ proceeded to fling the saddle on
the picketed hoss. Horace was smilinâ purty contented with himself,
until I sez: âWhich hoss are you goinâ to ride to-morrow, Mr.
Bradford?â

Then his face went blank as he recalled the blow-up weâd had that
morninâ gettinâ the pack ponies contented with their loads. âBy Jove,
I canât ride any of them!â he exclaims. âIt would kill me to have a
hoss buck with me. Iâm so sore now I can hardly move.â

âYou donât look as nervous as you did, though,â I sez to him for
comfort.

He didnât pay me no heed. âHere, Williams,â he calls, âyou canât take
that hoss. Heâs the only one I can ride, and youâll have to catch
another.â

âYou ort have thought oâ that before,â sez Tank, goinâ on with his
arrangements, but movinâ slow.

âWell, you two straighten it out among yourselves,â sez I. âIâm goinâ
back to bed. No wonder youâre nervous. It would make a saw-horse
nervous to jibe around the way you two do.â

I went off grumblinâ, anâ I went to sleep before they settled it; but
Tank stretched it out as much as he could, anâ Horace didnât oversleep
any that night. Next morninâ when I looked out, I saw him tied up with
his back againâ a tree, anâ Tankâs head in his lap. He was swathed in
his slicker anâ saddle-blanket to keep warm, anâ was sound asleep. He
looked purty well hammered out, but hanged if he didnât look a lot
more worth while ân he did when he started to take my treatment.

It seemed a shame to do it, as it was just gettinâ into the gray; but
I woke him up, anâ asked him in a whisper what he was doinâ. He sat
anâ blinked at me for a full minute before he remembered what or where
he was, anâ then he told me that he finally induced Tank to try havinâ
his head rubbed again, by lettinâ Tank truss him up so he couldnât
keel over on him. âGee, but Iâm cold anâ stiff,â he sez in a husky,
raspinâ voice. âI donât see how it can be so hot daytimes, anâ so cold
nights.â

âThisâll do you a world of good, Mr. Bradford,â sez I. âYou see, you
swell up with the heat daytimes, anâ crimp down with the cold nights;
anâ this will goad on your circulation, fry the lard out oâ ya, anâ
give your nerves a chance to get toned up.â I quoted from the patent
medicine almanac occasional, just so he wouldnât forget he was takinâ
treatment.

âI canât possibly ride, to-day,â he sez, shakinâ his head. âHonest,
Iâm in agony.â

âThatâs just âcause youâre stiff,â sez I, kindly. âThatâll all wear
off when the sun softens up your joint-oil. Why, man, youâll look back
on this trip as one oâ the brightest spots in your whole life.â

âI got hit in the back oâ the head with a golf ball once,â he flares
back real angry; âanâ that showed me a lot oâ brightness, too. I donât
want no more brightness, anâ I donât intend to ride to-day.â

I was especial pleased at the human traits he was displayinâ. He
hadnât acted so healthy anâ natural since heâd been with us, anâ I was
encouraged to keep on with the treatment. âYou will have to ride with
us, even if we have to tie you on,â I sez. âWe are now close to the
Injun country, anâ weâre responsible for you. Oâ course theâ ainât any
danger from regular war parties; but Injun boys is just as full oâ
devilment as white boys, anâ they havenât as many safety valves.
Theyâre all the time sneakinâ off anâ playinâ at war, anâ they play a
purty stiff game, too, believe me. If a dozen oâ these voting bucks,
eighteen or twenty years old, was to stalk us, theyâd try most earnest
to lift our hair.â

âIâd as soon be killed one way as another,â he sez. âI canât stand it
to ride, anâ thatâs all theâ is to it.â

Here was a queer thing: the little cuss actually wasnât afeared of
Injuns, which I had counted on as my big card. Nerves or no nerves,
Horace Walpole Bradford wasnât no coward; âcause we are all afeared oâ
crazy folks, anâ he thought Tank was crazy. If Tank had had two good
eyes, chances are he wouldnât âaâ feared him; so I kicked Tank in the
side anâ woke him up.




CHAPTER TEN

INJUNS!


Well, we sure had a hard time gettinâ Horace in the saddle that day.
He was some like a burro, small but strong minded. Finally he agreed
to try it if we would put the saddle-blanket on top the saddle instead
of underneath.

âThe hoss donât need it as bad as I do,â sez he; ââcause heâs covered
all over with hoss-hide anâ has hair for paddinâ besides; and
furthermore, the saddle is lined with sheepskin underneath, while itâs
as hard as iron on top; and Iâm just like a boil wherever I touch it.â

We told him that a hard saddle was lots the easiest as soon as a
feller got used to it; but he broke in anâ said he didnât expect to
live that long, anâ that we could take our choice of leavinâ him, or
puttinâ the saddle-blanket on top. Theâs lots of folks with the notion
that a soft saddle or a soft chair or a soft bed is the easiest; anâ
it ainât much use to argue with âem, though the truth is, that if a
feller lived on goslinâ down, heâd get stuck with a pin feather some
day anâ die oâ loss of blood; while if he lived on jagged stones, heâd
finally wear into âem until he had a smooth, perfect fittinâ mold for
his body. Still, the truth is only the truth to them âat can see it;
so we put the blanket on top, anâ perched Horace astride it.

He stood it two hours, anâ then said it was stretchinâ his legs so âat
he was afeared a sudden jerk would split him to the chin; anâ then we
put the saddle on right, anâ he found it full as easy as it had been
the day before. The best way, anâ the easiest anâ the quickest, to
toughen up, is just to toughen up. The human body can stand almost
anything in the way oâ hardship. After it has sent up word, hour after
hour, that it is beinâ hurt, anâ no attention gets paid to it, why, it
sets to work to remedy things on its own hook. In order to ride
comfortable, a lot of muscles have to loosen anâ stretch. Most oâ the
pain in ridinâ comes from ridinâ with set muscles. A feller canât
balance easy with set muscles, itâs just one straininâ jerk after
another, anâ the trick oâ ridinâ is to move with the horse. Just as
soon as ya get to goinâ right along with the hoss, loose anâ rubbery,
you take the strain off oâ both you anâ him; but while youâre bumpinâ
againâ him, itâs painful for both.

We rode about forty miles that day; and at the end of it Horace wasnât
complaininâ any worse ân at the start. Well, he couldnât, as far as
that goes; but his body had already begun to find the motion oâ the
hoss. Of course he hadnât learned to balance, anâ he still rode rigid;
but we had give him an easy-gaited old hammock, anâ when we drew up to
make camp, he sat on his hoss without holdinâ to the horn, anâ said he
was beginninâ to like it. When Tank lifted him down, though, his legs
wobbled under him like rubber anâ he squashed down in a heap,
groaninâ. We let him sleep where he lit while we were gettinâ supper;
âcause we was sure he would need it before morninâ. He wasnât nervous
any longer; all he wanted was food, sleep, anâ a lung full oâ tobacco
smoke. I felt rather proud oâ my treatment.

Tank had to boot him about purty freely to waken him up enough to take
his vittles; but he took a good lot of âem, anâ I was glad of it,
âcause this was the night the Injuns were goinâ to attack us, anâ he
wasnât scheduled to have any more solid nourishment until we got back
to the ranch house. After supper he went to his pipe like a young duck
to a puddle oâ water. He hadnât learned to handle his moisture while
smokinâ a pipe, anâ when the pipe began to gargle, he muttered a
little cuss-word under his breath. H. Walpole Bradford was cominâ out
wonderful.

The stiffeninâ had all blew out oâ the rim of his hat, givinâ the sun
full swing at him, anâ his nose looked like a weakly tomato flung in a
bed oâ geraniums. He had wrinkled up his face around where his glasses
fit, anâ now with the sun gone down his skin had loosened up again,
showinâ the unburned wrinkles like painted marks. He sure did look
tough! He was wearinâ a gray suit with a belt around the middle anâ
canvas leggins.

Along about nine oâclock he nodded over into the fire, right at the
most excitinâ part of an Injun tale which Tank was makinâ up for his
especial benefit. We fished him out anâ shook him awake; but he came
to as cross as a hornet, anâ swore he was goinâ to sleep right where
he was with all his clothes on.

âYouâre a wise pigeon to sleep with your clothes on, to-night,â sez
Tank; ââcause this is the Injun country, anâ ya canât tell whatâll
happen; but the best plan for us to do is to divide up anâ keep watch
durinâ the night.â

âKeep watch!â yells Horace, glarinâ at Tank. âI wouldnât keep watch
to-night if I was bound to a torture stake. You can keep watch if you
want toâanâ it wouldnât discommode you no more ân if you was an owl.
Your dog-gone, doubly condemned nerves wonât let you nor any one else
sleepâbut Iâm goinâ to get some rest if I die for it.â

âYouâre a nice one, you are!â sez Tank. âThis here expedition was got
up just on account oâ your nerves, anâ now that weâve come to the most
important point of all, why, you flam out anâ put all the risk on us.â

âYou make me tired,â sez Horace, scowlinâ at Tank as fierce as a
cornered mouse. âIf youâre so everlastinâ feared oâ the Injunsâwhat
ya got this bloominâ fire for?â

âWe donât intend to sleep near the fire, Mr. Bradford,â sez I,
soothinâ. âWe intend to roll up our beds like as if we was in âem anâ
then sneak off into the bushes anâ sleep. We donât want any trouble if
we can avoid it. If youâll notice, youâll see we havenât turned the
hosses out to-night.â

âThese here Injuns is livinâ on a reservation,â sez he, âanâ I donât
believe âat theyâd dare outrage us.â

I was indignant with the little cuss for not beinâ afeared of Injuns.
My theory was, âat nerves was a lot like hosses: keep a hoss shut up
anâ heâll get bad anâ kick anâ raise Cain; but take him out anâ ride
his hide loose, anâ heâll simmer down considâable. I wanted to give
Horaceâs nerves such a complete stringinâ out that they wouldnât worry
him any more for a year; anâ here he was, not carinâ a hang for
Injuns. âBeliefs is all right to the believers,â sez I, stiffeninâ up;
âbut facts is facts whether you believe in âem or not. Every Injun
outrage since the Civil War was planned on a reservation, anâ we canât
take no chances.â

While he was studyinâ over this with a pouty look on his face, Tank
sez: âItâs time we fixed up anâ moved out into the darkâ; so we put
rolls oâ brush in the beds, anâ went on up the side oâ the rise where
theâ was a level spot I knew of, Horace stumblinâ anâ grumblinâ every
step oâ the way. We were about two hundred yards from the fire anâ it
looked cozy anâ cheerful, dancinâ away beside the tarps. I was half a
mind to join in with Horace, anâ go on back; but our plans were all
laid, anâ besides, I had a little bet up with Spider Kelley, that Iâd
return Horace in such fine condition that heâd be willinâ to drink
blood or milk a cow calf-fashion.

âYou go to sleep first,â sez Tank to Horace; âIâll watch till I get
sleepy anâ then Iâll call Happy, heâll watch two hours, anâ if it
ainât dawn by that time, heâll call you. I may not get sleepy at all,
but you know how nerves is. I stayed awake ninety-six hours once, anâ
couldnât get a speck sleepy. Then I decided to stay out the even
hundred anâ see how far I could jump after stayinâ awake a hundred
hours. I went to sleep in ten minutes anâ didnât wake up for two
daysâso Iâm liable to be took sleepy to-night.â

We had brought the slickers up, anâ Horace rolled up in one, under a
low evergreen, and began to snore in half a minute. As soon as he had
got to wrastlinâ with his breath in earnest, I went to the head oâ the
trail anâ whistled for Spider Kelley. He anâ four others were there,
anâ I told âem it was all right to start in an hour, anâ then I came
back to Horace chucklinâ. Spider enjoyed anything like this, anâ he
had fixed up the boys with feathers anâ fringe anâ smears oâ chalk anâ
raspberry jam, till they looked as evil-minded as any Injuns Iâd ever
seen.

We set Horaceâs watch ahead five hours. Tank curled up anâ went to
sleep, anâ then I started to wake Horace up. It took so long; to get
him to consciousness that I feared the hour would be up; but he
finally got so he remembered what he was, anâ then I told him not to
make any fuss if he saw any Injuns, but to just wake us up. I tried to
get him to take one oâ my guns, but I didnât wear triggers on âem anâ
he didnât savvy snap-shootinâ, so he took a club in his hand anâ
started to parade.

He looked at his watch while I was stretchinâ out in his warm spot,
anâ he looked at it again before I was through looseninâ up my
muscles. It beats the world how slow time crawls to a man on watch. I
was sleepy myself, but Iâd have bit out my tongue before Iâd have give
in. I lay half on my right side with my hat drawn down, watchinâ
Horace. After about ten minutes, he pulled out his watch again anâ
looked at it. He pulled out the snap to set it ahead, in order to fool
us, but he was troubled with too much morality, so he snapped it shut
anâ spoke to himself between his set teeth for several moments.

I reckon he must have kept on his feet for twenty minutes, anâ then he
settled down with his face to the fire, which I had fed up on my way
back from seeinâ Spider, anâ said loud enough for me to hear: âThis is
all damn foolishness.â

He said it so slow anâ solemn anâ earnest, that I purt nigh choked;
but I kept still, he kept still, anâ the fire kept dancinâ before him.
His breathinâ grew deep anâ steady, his nerves was all coiled up
comfortable; and tired muscles donât make a feller wakeful. Purty soon
Horace began to gargle his palate, anâ then I was ready for Spider
Kelley.

The plan was for him to come up close so as to entertain Horace while
his braves sneaked on to the dummies in the tarps; but theâ was no
occasion for sneakinâ. Horace had turned over the camp to fate, anâ he
wasnât worryinâ his head about what was goinâ to happen to it.

Finally, Spider got disgusted anâ he went down anâ joined the others,
anâ they sure raised a riot; but all the time, Horace slumbered on.
Spider caught up our hosses, put our saddles anâ packs on âem, threw
some pieces of old canvas he brought along on the fire; and he anâ the
rest raised a wild warwhoop and galloped away; but Horace was too busy
to pay any attention. Spider anâ the boys had to work next day, anâ
they was some put out not to have a little more fun for their trouble.
It was all Spider could do to keep âem from sneakinâ back anâ
kidnappinâ Horace, but this was liable to give the whole thing away,
so he talked âem out of it. As soon as the noise had died down, I set
Horaceâs watch back five hours, anâ then I went to sleep myself. It
was purty chilly, and I wasnât quite sure who the joke was on.

When Tank woke up, he started in on Horace; but his noise wakened me
up first. When Horace saw what had happened to the camp, he was about
wordless; but after we had called him down about it for five or ten
minutes, he flared up anâ talked back as harsh as we did. He said âat
he had kept guard for over three hours, fightinâ off sleep by walkinâ
back anâ forth; and hadnât sat down until it had started to lighten in
the sky. He stuck to this tale, and Iâm sure he believed it himself.
Heâd been so sleepy the night before that he couldnât have told a
dream from an actual happeninâ, so when he began to get excited, we
dropped it.

âAll right,â sez Tank at last; âyouâve put us into a nice fix, but
theâ ainât no use tryinâ to pickle yesterday. What weâve got to do is
to hoof it back, anâ we might as well begin. Weâre in a nice fix:
nothinâ to eat, not a single cabin on the road back, anâ for all we
know theâs a pack of Injuns watchinâ us this blessid moment.â

âHow do ya know it was Injuns?â sez Horace.

âLook there, anâ there, anâ there,â sez Tank, pointinâ at moccasin
prints anâ feathers. âThen besides, no white men would âaâ burned up
the tarps.â

âDo you mean to say âat we got to walk all the way back?â sez Horace.

âAll the way, anâ without no grub,â sez Tank.

Horace sat down on the end of a charred log. âWell, Iâll die right
here,â sez he. âThis spot suits me as well as any other.â

âYou donât have to die at all,â sez I. âA body can go forty days
without food, anâ it does more good than harm.â Friar Tuck had told me
a lot about fastinâ, anâ I was keen to try it out on Horace. From all
I could see from the theory oâ fastinâ, it was just what was needed
for Horaceâs nerves.

âLook at me,â sez Horace, pullinâ at the waist of his clothes. âI bet
Iâve lost twenty pounds already, on this fool trip. Twenty pounds more
would make me a corpse, anâ Iâd just as soon be made one here as
anywhere. As soon as I rest up a little, Iâm goinâ to begin to yell
until I draw those blame Injuns back, anâ have âem finish the job in
short order.â

He wasnât bluffinâ, he was simply despârit. âYouâll have to walk with
us,â sez I; âcome on.â

Tank took one arm, anâ I took the other, anâ we started forth. For the
first hour he hung back, and then he began to step out on his own
hook. When we rested at noon, he was the freshest one of us. Tank anâ
I had ridinâ boots, anâ ridinâ muscles; while he had walkinâ shoes,
anâ no muscles at all worth mentioninâ. âI can play at this game as
well as any one,â sez Horace, chewinâ a blade oâ grass, anâ lookinâ
proud of himself.

Tank was purty well fussed up; he wasnât workinâ out any theories, he
had just come along to help pester Horace anâ have a little amusement;
but it began to appear to him that his fun was cominâ high-priced.

By nightfall we was all tolâable hungry; but Horace was so set up over
beinâ able to put over a full dayâs walk on nothinâ to eat that he was
purty speechy, anâ it was nine oâclock before he went to sleep. As
soon as he had dropped off, I went down to meet Spider Kelley anâ get
the grub he had brought out for me ânâ Tank. He said âat the other
boys wasnât bragginâ none about their trip the night before; but they
were all ready to roast me anâ Tank as soon as we got in. Weâd had it
fixed that Spider anâ the rest was to take turns worryinâ Horace on
the back trip; but Spider said that it looked to him as if Iâd win the
bet anyway, so he intended to play neutral from that on. As soon as me
anâ Tank had eaten, we turned in, anâ all of us slept like logs.




CHAPTER ELEVEN

BENEFITS OF FASTING


The next day Horace walked easier ân any of us. Now Iâm tellinâ this
to ya straight ânâ you can believe it or not just as ya please; but
that little cuss stepped right along, began to notice the scenery, anâ
even cracked a few jokes now anâ again; while me anâ Tank just plodded
with our minds fixed on the meal we were goinâ to get that night.
Horace had give up all thought oâ meals, so they didnât pester him
any.

At the end of the third day Horace had lost his appetite complete.
Friar Tuck had swore that hunger didnât worry a man more ân three
days, anâ sure enough, it didnât. Horace didnât care whether he ever
et again or not. Heâd get a little dizzy when heâd start out, anâ once
in a while heâd feel a bit fainty; but as far as beinâ ravenous went,
me an Tank had him beat a mile.

âWhere is the joke oâ this fool trip?â growled Tank to me on the
eveninâ of the fourth day as we were eatinâ the supper Spider Kelley
had brought out. âHe ainât a human at all, Horace ainât; heâs a
reptile, anâ can live without food.â

Spider was tickled a lot, and said he didnât care if he did lose his
bet, that it was worth it to find how everlastinâ tough a little
half-hand like Horace could be when drove to it. Iâd been thinkinâ it
over all day, but I didnât say anything.

Friar Tuck had said it was a question of will power, more ân anything
else: that if a man just held his thoughts away from food it wouldnât
bother him; but if he kept thinkinâ of it, the digestinâ juices would
flow into his stomach anâ make him think he was starvinâ; so I was
minded to try a new plan next day.

âSpider,â I sez, âyou put a cow anâ calf up in Nuftyâs Corralââwhich
was the name of a little shut-in park we would go through the next
afternoon. âPut âem there in the morninâ, a cow with an off brand, if
you can find one, anâ trim their hoofs down close, so they wonât go
back to the bunch. Remember âat weâre on foot, anâ trim âem close
enough to make it hurt âem to walk. Iâm goinâ to make Horace hungry if
I can.â

âI hate to play againâ him and my own bet,â sez Spider; âbut Iâll have
the cow there, just to see what youâre up to. If youâre goinâ to
butcher it, though, I donât see why a young steer wouldnât be better.â

âIâll count on you havinâ it there,â sez I; anâ then Spider rode back
to the ranch house, anâ me anâ Tank went to sleep.

Next morninâ me anâ Tank put the cartridges out of our belts into our
pockets. As soon as we started to walk I began to talk about my
hunger, anâ weakness, anâ the empty feelinâ in my head anâ stomach. At
first Horace didnât pay any heed; but from the start, olâ Tank
Williams caught every symptom I suggested; until I feared heâd curl up
on the trail anâ die oâ starvation. Finally, though, Horace began to
pay heed to my suggestions, anâ to sigh anâ moan a little. What
finally got him was my gnawinâ at my rope anâ gauntlet. Tank anâ I had
saved our ropes, âcause we expected to have need of âem; and when noon
came anâ I sat with a stupid look in my face, chewinâ first the rope,
anâ then the wrist oâ the gauntlet, Horace began to have some of the
symptoms I was fishinâ for. Finally he borrowed one oâ my gauntlets,
anâ after he had munched on it a while, he was as hungry as any one
could wish.

âI canât go another peg,â he sez when I got up to start on again.

âHow does that come?â I asked him. âWhen we stopped to rest you was
feelinâ more chipper ân any of us.â

âIâm dyinâ oâ hunger,â he replied, solemn. âIâve got a gnawinâ pain in
my stomach, anâ Iâm all in. I fear my stomach is punctured or stuck
together or somethinâ.â

I had had a lot oâ discussions with Friar Tuck about the power oâ
suggestion; but I had never took much stock in it. I could see now,
though, that it actually did work. As long as Horace was tellinâ
himself that everything was all right, why, it was all right. Then
when I suggested âat we were dyinâ of hunger, why, he actually began
to die of hunger; anâ it was wonderful to see the change in him. He
showed us how he had ganted down; and the fact was, his bones had
become purty prominent without any help from suggestinâ. He didnât
have any more belly ân a snake; but his eyes were bright, anâ his skin
clear, except that it was peelinâ off purty splotchy, from sun-burn.

We finally left him anâ started on; and after weâd got some distance,
he staggered after us; but he was just goinâ on his nerve now, anâ not
gettinâ much joy out of existence.

About four in the afternoon, we reached Nuftyâs Corral, a fine little
park with only a narrow entrance at each end. Horace was up with us by
this time, anâ we were all ploddinâ along head down. Suddenly Horace
grabbed us by the arms. âHush!â he sez.

âWhatâs up?â sez I, lookinâ at him.

âLook,â he whispers, pointinâ at the cow anâ calf; âthereâs food.â

We drew back anâ consulted about it. âThe great danger after a fast,â
I sez in warninâ, âlies in overeatinâ. All we can do is to drink a
little blood for the first few hours.â

âWhy canât we broil a steak over some coals?â sez Horace.

âIt would kill us to eat steak now,â sez I.

He held out for the steak; but I finally sez that if he wonât promise
to be temperate anâ eat only what I tell him, Iâll drive off the cow;
and then he comes around, and agrees to it.

âYou sneak around to the far openinâ, Tank,â I sez, then I pauses, anâ
looks at him as though shocked. âWhereâs your cartridges, man?â I
asked.

Tank felt of his belt, and seemed plumb beat out, then he looked at
mine, anâ yelled, âWhereâs yours?â

We both sat down on stones anâ went over what we had done every minute
oâ the time since we had started out; until Horace became frantic, anâ
sez: âWhatâs the difference what became of âem? Your revolvers are
loaded. You can sure kill one cow out oâ twenty-four shots.â

âTwenty shots,â I corrected. âWe allus carry the hammer on an empty
chamber; anâ Iâm so bloominâ weak I doubt if I could hit a cow in ten
shots.â

Horace turned loose anâ told us what he thought of us, anâ it was
edifyinâ to hearken to himâhe hit the nail on the head so often.
Finally I sez: âWell, a man can do no more than tryâGo ahead, Tank,
but donât let her get by you, whatever happens.â

The cow, which was a homely grade-whiteface with a splotch on her nose
which made it look as if most of the nose had been cut off, stood in
the center of the park, anâ she was beginninâ to get uneasy, although
the wind was from her way.

As soon as Tank got to his entrance he shot in the air; anâ she came
charginâ down on me. I shot over her, anâ she charged back. We kept
this up until Horace lost patience anâ called me a confounded dub.
âHere,â sez I, âtheâs two cartridges left. You fire âem, I wonât.â

At first he refused, but he was desperate, and finally after Iâd told
him to use both hands, he took a shot. The cow was standinâ closest to
us, but lookinâ Tankâs way, anâ Horace nicked her in the ham. Instead
of charginâ Tank, like a sensible cow, she came for us head on. Now,
when a bull charges, he picks out somethinâ to steer for, then closes
his eyes, and sets sail; but a cow keeps her eyes open, anâ she donât
aim to waste any plunges either. Horace stood out in the center of the
entrance anâ banged away again, strikinâ the ground about ten feet in
front of him.

âRun!â I yells to him, jumpinâ back behind a big rock, âRun!â

He forgot all about beinâ hungry, anâ he started to backtrail like a
scared jack-rabbit. The cow had forgot all about havinâ had her hoofs
pared, anâ she took after him like a hungry coyote. As she passed me,
I roped her, took a snub around the rock, anâ flopped her; but she did
just what I thought sheâd doârolled to her feet anâ took after me.
She was angry. Iâd have given right smart for a tough little pony
between my knees.

[Illustration: The cow had forgot all about havinâ had her hoofs
pared, anâ she took after him like a hungry coyote]

The rock was too big to get a half hitch over, so I just ran at right
angles from her, hopinâ to stretch out more rope ân she could cover. I
did it by a few feet; but she swung around into my rope head on, anâ
this flung me up againâ her side. I managed to hang on to the rope,
however, anâ this fixed her, âcause sheâd have had to pull that rock
over before she could âaâ come any farther. Horace had stopped anâ was
gappinâ at us from a safe distance; but Tank arrived by this time anâ
put another rope on her anâ we had her cross-tied between two big
rocks by the time Horace arrived.

âWhat ya goinâ to kill her with?â he asked, his eyes dancinâ like an
Injunâs at the beef whack-up.

âMy cartridges are all gone,â sez Tank.

âMine too,â sez I.

âCanât you use a knife, or a stone?â sez Horace, the dude.

âYou can try it if you want to,â sez I; âbut hanged if I will.â

He took a big stone anâ walked to the head of the cow, but his nerve
gave out, anâ he threw down the stone. âWhat in thunder did you tie
her up for, then?â sez he.

âI beg your pardon,â sez I, âbut I thought perhaps she might be a
little vexed with you on account oâ your shootinâ her up. She was
headed your way.â

He sat down on a stone anâ looked at the cow resentful. Suddenly his
face lit up. âWhy donât you milk her?â sez he. âWe can live on milk
for weeks.â

Itâs funny how much alike hungry animals look. As Horace sat on the
stone with his anxious face, his poppinâ eyes, his mussed up
side-burns, anâ the water drippinâ from his mouth at thought oâ the
milk, he looked so much like a setter pup I once knew that it was all
I could do to hold a straight face.

âDo you know how to milk, Tank?â I sez.

âI donât,â sez Tank; ânor I donât know what it tastes like.â

âGo ahead anâ milk her, Mr. Bradford,â I sez. âYouâre the only one
what knows how to milk, or who cares to drink it. What you goinâ to
milk it in?â

âI never milked in my life,â sez he; âbut I saw it done once when I
was a boy, anâ Iâm goinâ to try to milk in my hat.â

He had a bad time of it; but he only got kicked twice, anâ both times
it was short, glancinâ blows, not much more ân shoves. Finally, he
came over to where me anâ Tank was settinâ anâ flopped himself down
beside us. âCanât you strangle her with those ropes?â he sez, in what
might well be called deadly earnest.

We shook our heads, anâ continued to sit there lookinâ at the cow as
though we expected sheâd point the way out of our trouble. Presently
the calf remembered his own appetite, anâ rushed up anâ gave a
demonstration of what neat anâ orderly milkinâ was. Horace sighed.
âGee, I bet thatâs good,â he said, the water drippinâ from his lips
again. He had been four days without food, walkinâ all that time
through the mountains, sleepinâ out doors with no cover but a slicker;
and he had about burned up all his waste products, which Friar Tuck
said was a city manâs greatest handicap. His eyes got a little red as
he watched the calf, anâ I saw that he meant to slaughter it; so I sez
to him: âThatâs the way to milk, Mr. Bradford. Why donât you sneak up
on the other side anâ try it that way, the same time the calf is?â

He studied a moment, anâ then shook his head. âNo, she could tell me
from the calf,â he said sorrowful. âOur foreheads are shaped
different, anâ Iâd have to get down on my hands and knees. Sheâd tell
me in a minute, anâ I donât want to be on my hands anâ knees when she
kicks me.â

âWe could throw anâ hog-tie her,â sez Tank; âand you could get it easy
anâ comfortable. Would you want us to do that, Mr. Bradford?â

Horace jumped to his feet anâ shook his fist in Tankâs face. âDonât
call me Mister again,â he yelled. âIâm plumb sick of it. If I ever
live to get another bath anâ back East where theâs food in plenty,
why, Iâll take up the Mister again; but now that Iâve got to a point
where I have to suck milk from a hog-tied cow, you call me Horace, or
even Dinkyâwhich was my nickname at school. Yes, for heavenâs sake,
tie the cow. I have to have milk, anâ thatâs the only way I see to get
it.â

Well, Tank anâ I was so full oâ laugh we could hardly truss up the
cow; but we finally got her on her back so âat she couldnât do nothinâ
but snap her tail, anâ then Horace threw his hat on the ground, anâ
started in. I was entirely joyful: I knew âat Spider Kelley, anâ as
many oâ the boys as could sneak away, were watchinâ us from up on the
hill, anâ this was the grand triumph of my treatment for nerves.

Horace approached the cow with considâable caution, as she was in an
awkward position. The calf had been interrupted in his meal, before he
had squenched his thirst, anâ he was still prospectinâ about on his
own hook.

âHere,â said Horace, givinâ him a push, âthis is my turn.â

You know how a calf is: a calf ainât afeared oâ nothinâ except hunger.
Here was his food-supply beinâ robbed, right when he was needinâ it.
He blatted down in his throat, anâ tried to nose Horace out of the
way. Horace was findinâ that milk the best stuff he had ever tasted,
anâ he fought off the calf with his right hand, while he steadied
himself by puttinâ his left on the hind leg oâ the calfâs mother, anâ
got a nice coat oâ creamy froth in his side-burns. He was so blame
hungry he didnât see a speck oâ humor in it; but me anâ Tank nearly
died.

âSay,â sez Horace, raisinâ his head, the milk drippinâ from his lips,
âcanât one oâ you fellers fend off this calf till I finish?â

Tank held the calf while I advised Horace to be temperate, anâ after a
bit he gave a sigh anâ said, that that was all he could hold just
then, but not to let the cow escape. We loosened her, left one oâ the
ropes on for a drag picket, anâ took off the other. She was purty well
subdued; but we refused to give Horace any more milk that night, anâ
he went to sleep before we had a fire built. Spider Kelley was
wabblinâ with laughter when he brought us our supper. He had been the
only one who could stay after bringinâ up the cow; but he said he
wouldnât âaâ missed it for three jobs.




CHAPTER TWELVE

A COMPLETE CURE


Next morninâ we fed Horace all the milk he could hold, anâ tried to
drive the cow along with us; but her hoofs had been pared so thin that
it made her cross anâ we had to give that projecâ up.

âHow far are we from the ranch house?â asked Horace.

âAbout sixty miles,â sez Tank.

âThatâs what I thought,â sez he. âNow, I canât see any sense in all of
us hoofinâ that distance. Iâd go if I knew the way; but one of you
could go, anâ the other stay with me anâ the cow. Then the one which
went could bring back food on the buckboard, and it would be as good
as if we all went.â

Now this was a fine scheme; but neither Tank nor I had thought of it.
We had intended to follow our own windinâ circle back every step oâ
the way; but when the milk set Horaceâs brain to pumpinâ, he fetched
up this idee which saved us all a lot oâ bother.

âI shall go myself,â sez Tank; âweak as I am, Iâll go myself.â

It was only about fifteen or twenty miles by the short cut, anâ this
would get him back to regular meals in short order; so he left me his
rope anâ set out. Horace helped me with the cow that night, anâ he
proved purty able help. He was feelinâ fine, anâ the milk had filled
him out wonderful. He said he hadnât felt so rough ânâ ready for
twenty years; but Spider Kelley failed to arrive with my meal that
night, and I went to bed feelinâ purty well disgusted. Tank had met
him before noon that day, anâ he had gone in for a hoss; and they had
decided that it would be a good stunt to give me some oâ my own
treatment.

Next morninâ I felt as empty as a balloon; so after Horace had enjoyed
himself, I took a little oâ the same, myself; but I didnât take it
like he did. I held my mouth open anâ squirted it in, anâ it was
mighty refreshinâ.

âHuh,â sez Horace, âyouâre mightily stuck up. The calfâs way is good
enough for me.â

âI got a split lip,â I sez, half ashamed oâ myself.

They left us there three days to allow for the time it would have
taken Tank to walk if it had been as far as we claimed it was; and
then Tillte Dutch drove out the buckboard. He said âat Spider anâ Tank
had quit and gone into Boggs for a little recreation; but after I had
eaten my first meal out oâ the grub he brought, I didnât bear âem any
ill will. The joke was on me as much as it was on Horace; but Iâd âaâ
gone through twice as much to test that theory, anâ Iâd had the full
worth oâ my bother. Horace was a new man: he was full oâ vim anâ snap,
anâ he gave me credit for it anâ became mighty friendly anâ
confidential.

He stood up in the buckboard anâ made a farewell speech to the cow
which lasted ten minutes. He also apologized to the calf, anâ told him
that when he got back East, he would raise his hat every time he
passed a milk wagon. He sure felt in high spirits, and made up a
ramblinâ sort of a song which lasted all the way back to the house. It
had the handiest tune ever invented and he got a lot oâ fun out of it.
It began:

    âOh we walked a thousand miles without eatinâ any food,
    Anâ then we met a cow anâ calf, anâ gee, but they looked good!
    Her eyes like ancient Junoâs were so in-o-cent anâ mild,
    We couldnât bear to take her life, we only robbed her child.
    She strove to save the lactual juice to feed her darling boy;
    So we had to fling her on her back to fill our souls with joy.
    Now Tank anâ Happy were too proud to compete with a calf,
    So they sat them down anâ dined on wind, while they weakly
      tried to laugh.
    Iâm but a simple-minded cuss, not proud like one of these;
    So I filled myself so full of milk, Iâm now a cottage cheese.â

Horace was as proud oâ this song as though it was the first one ever
sung. He used the same tune on it that blind men on corners use. I
reckon that tune fits most any sort of a song; itâs more like the
âWearinâ of the Greenâ than anything else but ten times sadder anâ
more monotonous. He said he had once wrote a Greek song at college but
it wasnât a patch on this one, and hadnât got him nothinâ but a medal.
I used to know twelve or eighteen verses, but Iâve forgot most of it.
It was a hard one to remember because the verses wasnât of the same
length. Sometimes a feller would have to stretch a word all out of
shape to make it cover the wave oâ the tune, anâ sometimes youâd have
to huddle the words all up into a bunch. Horace said that all high
class music was this way; but it made it lots more bother to learn
than hymns.

The verse which pleased me the most was the forty-third. Horace
himself said âat this was about as good as any, though he liked the
seventy-ninth one a shade better, himself. The forty-third one ran:

    âA cow-boy does not live on milk, thatâs all a boy-cowâll drink;
    But the cow-ma loves the last the most, which seems a funny think,
    I do not care for milk in pans with yellow scum oâer-smeared.
    I like to gather mine myself; and strain it through my beard.â

I never felt better over anything in my life than I did over returninâ
Horace in this condition. It was some risk to experiment with such a
treatment as mine on a feller who regarded himself as an invalid; but
here he was, cominâ back solid anâ hearty, with his shape shrunk down
to normal, anâ full oâ jokes anâ song.

Tillte Dutch had been one oâ the braves in Spiderâs Injun party; so
when we got in, about ten in the eveninâ, he lured the rest oâ the
pack out to the corral, anâ we agreed not to make the details of our
trip public. The olâ man wouldnât have made a whole lot oâ fuss seeinâ
as it had turned out all right; but still, he was dead set on what he
called courtesy to guests; and he might âaâ thought that we had played
Horace a leetle mite strong. Barbie noticed the change in Horace and,
oâ course, she pumped most oâ the story out oâ me.

Horace himself was as game a little rooster as I ever saw. He follered
me around like a dog after that, helpinâ with my chores, anâ ridinâ
every chance he had. He got confidential, anâ told me a lot about
himself. He said that he hadnât never had any boyhood, that his mother
was a rich widow, anâ was ambitious to make a scholar out of him; that
she had sent him to all kinds oâ schools anâ colleges anâ
universities, and had had private tutors for him, and had jammed his
head so full oâ learninâ that theâ wasnât room for his brain to beat;
so it had just lain smotherinâ amidst a reek of all kinds oâ musty old
facts. He said that he never had had time for exercise, and had never
needed money; so he had just settled into a groove lined with books
anâ not leadinâ anywhere at all. He said that since his motherâs death
he had been livinâ like a regular recluse, thinkinâ dead thoughts in
dead languages, anâ not takinâ much interest in anything which had
happened since the fall oâ Rome; but now that he had learned for the
first time what a world of enjoyment theâ was in just feelinâ real
life poundinâ through his veins, he intended to plunge about in a way
to increase the quality, quantity, and circulation of his blood.

Ya couldnât help likinâ a feller who took things the way he didâwe
all liked him. He told us to treat him just as if he was a
fourteen-year-old boy, which we did, anâ theâ wasnât nothinâ in the
way of a joke that he wasnât up against before the summer was over;
but he came back at us now anâ again, good anâ plenty.

Tank anâ Spider tossinâ up their jobs had left me with more work on my
hands ân I generally liked, so I had to stick purty close to the line
until they went broke anâ took on again. Then one day me anâ Horace
took a ride up into the hills. We had some lunch along and about noon
we sat down in a grassy spot to eat it. We had just finished and had
lighted our pipes for a little smoke when we heard Friar Tuck cominâ
up the trail. I hadnât seen him for months, anâ I was mighty glad to
hear him again. He was fair shoutinâ, so I knew âat things was right
side up with him. He was singinâ the one which begins: âOh, come, all
ye faithful, joyful anâ triumphant,â and he shook the echoes loose
with it.

Horace turned to me with a surprised look on his face; âWhoâs that?â
he sez.

âThatâs Friar Tuck,â sez I, âanâ if youâve got any troubles tell âem
to him.â

âWell, wouldnât that beat ya!â exclaimed Horace, anâ just then the
Friar came onto our level with his hat off anâ his head thrown back.
He was leadinâ a spare hoss, anâ seemed at peace with all the world.

When he spied me, he headed in our direction, anâ as soon as he had
finished the chorus, he called: âHello, Happy! What are you hidinâ
from up here?â

I jumped to my feet, anâ Horace got to his feet, too, anâ bowed anâ
said: âHow do ya do, Mr. Carmichael?â

A quick change came over the Friarâs face. It got cold anâ haughty;
and I was flabbergasted, because I had never seen it get that way
before. âHow do you do,â he said, as cheery anâ chummy as a
hail-storm.

But he didnât need to go to the trouble oâ freezinâ himself solid;
Horace was just as thin skinned as he was when it was necessary, anâ
he slipped on a snuffer over his welcominâ smile full as gloomy as was
the Friarâs. I was disgusted: nothinâ pesters me worse ân to think a
lot oâ two people who canât bear each other. It leaves it so blame
uncertain which one of us has poor taste.

Well, we had one oâ those delightful conflabs about the weather anâ
âhow hot it was daytimes, but so cool anâ refreshinâ nights,â anâ, âI
must be goinâ now,â anâ âoh, whatâs the use oâ goinâ so soonââand so
on. Then Horace anâ the Friar bowed anâ the Friar rode away as silent
anâ dignified as a dog which has been sent back home.

âWell,â sez Horace, after weâd seated ourselves again, âI never
expected to see that man out here. I wouldnât âaâ been more surprised
to have seen a blue fish with yaller goggles on, come swimminâ up the
pass.â

âOh, wouldnât ya?â sez I. âWell, that man ainât no more like a blue
fish with goggles on than you are. Heâs ace high anywhere you put him,
anâ donât you forget that.â

âYou neednât arch up your back about it,â he sez. âI havenât said
anything againâ him. I gave up goinâ to church on his account.â

âThatâs nothinâ to brag about,â sez I. âA manâll give up goinâ to
church simply because they hold it on Sunday, which is the one day oâ
the week when he feels most like stackinâ up his feet on top oâ
somethinâ anâ smokinâ a pipe. A man who couldnât plan out an excuse
for not goinâ to church wouldnât be enough intelligent to know when he
was hungry.â

âYou must âaâ set up late last night to whet your sarcasm!â sez
Horace, swellinâ up a little. âWhy donât you run along and hold up a
screen, so âat folks canât look at your parson.â

âHowâd you happen to quit church on his account?â sez I.

âHe was only a curate, when I first knew him,â sez Horace.

âHeâs a curate yet,â sez I. âI tried one of his cures myself, lately;
anâ it worked like a charm.â I turned my head away so âat Horace
wouldnât guess âat he was the cuss I had tried it on.

âA curate hasnât nothinâ to do with doctorinâ,â sez Horace. âA curate
is only the assistant of the regular preacher which is called a
rector. The curate does the hard work anâ the rector gets the big
pay.â

âThatâs the way with all assistants,â sez I; âso donât bother with any
more details. Why did you quit goinâ to church?â

âI quit because he quit,â sez Horace.

âWhat did he quit for,â sez I; âjust to bust up the church by drawinâ
your patronage away from it?â

âHe quit on account of a girl,â sez Horace; anâ then I stopped my
foolishness, anâ settled down to get the story out of him. Here Iâd
been wonderinâ for years about Friar Tuck; anâ all those weeks I had
been with Horace I had never once thought oâ tryinâ to see what he
might know.




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

AN UNEXPECTED CACHE


Humans is the most disappointinâ of all the animals: when a mule opens
his mouth, you know what sort of a noise is about to happen, anâ can
brace yourself accordinâ; anâ the same is true oâ screech-owls, anâ
guinea-hens anâ such; but no one can prepare for what is to come forth
when a human opens his mouth. You meet up with a professor what knows
all about the stars anâ the waterlines in the hills anâ the petrified
fishes, anâ such; but his method oâ beinâ friendly anâ agreeable is to
sing comic songs like a squeaky saw, anâ dance jigs as graceful as a
store box; while the fellow what can sing anâ dance is forever tryinâ
to lecture about stuff he is densely ignorant of.

The other animals is willinâ to do what they can do, anâ they take
pride in seeinâ how well they can do it; but not so a human. He only
takes pride in tryinâ to do the things he canât do. A hog donât try to
fly, nor a butterfly donât try to play the cornet, nor a cow donât set
anâ fret because she canât climb trees like a squirrel; but not so
with man: he has to try everything âat anything else ever tried, anâ
he donât care what it costs nor who gets killed in the attempt.
Sometimes you hear a wise guy say: âNo, no thatâs contrary to human
nature.â This is so simple minded it allus makes me silent. Human
nature is so blame contrary, itself, that nothinâ else could possibly
be contrary to it. To think of Horace knowinâ about the Friar, anâ yet
dogginâ me all over the map with that song of his, was enough to make
me shake him; but I didnât. I wanted the story, so I pumped him for
it, patient anâ persistent.

âI never was very religious,â began Horace. Most people begin stories
about other people, by tellinâ you a lot about themselves, so I had my
resignation braced for this. âI allus liked the Greek religion better
ân airy other,â he went on. âIt was a fine, free, joyous religion,
founded on Art anâ music, anâ symmetryââ

I was willinâ to stand for his own biography; but after waitinâ this
long for a clue to the Friarâs past, I wasnât resigned to hearinâ a
joint debate on the different religions; so I interrupted, by askinâ
if him believinâ in the Greek religion was what had made Friar Tuck
throw up his job.

âNo, you chump,ââme anâ Horace was such good friends by this time
that we didnât have any regard for one anotherâs feelinâs. âNo, you
chump,â he sez, âI told you he quit on account of a girl. I donât look
like a girl, do I?â

âWell,â sez I, studying him sober, âthose side-burns look as if they
might âaâ been bangs which had lost their holt in front anâ slipped
down to your lip; but aside from this you donât resemble a girl enough
to drive a man out oâ church.â

I allus had better luck with Horace after Iâd spurred him up a bit.

âYou see, Friar Tuck, as you call him, was a good deal of a fanatic,
those days,â sez Horace, after heâd thrown a stone at me. âHe took his
religion serious, anâ wanted to transform the world into what it would
be if all people tried their best to live actual Christ-like lives. He
was a big country boy, fresh from college, anâ full of ideals, anâ
feelinâ strong enough to hammer things out accordinâ to the pattern he
had chose.

âIt was his voice which got him his place. He had a perfectly
marvelous voice, anâ I never heard any one else read the service like
he did. This was what took me to church, and Iâd have gone as long as
he stayed. You see, Happy, life is really made up of sensations anâ
emotions; and it used to lift me into the clouds to see his shininâ
youth robed in white, anâ hear that wonderful voice of his fillinâ the
great, soft-lighted church with melody anâ mystery. It was all I asked
of religion anâ it filled me with peace anâ inspiration. Of course,
from a philosophical standpoint, the Greek religionââ

âDid the girl believe in the Greek religion?â I asked to switch him
back.

âNo, no,â he snapped. âThis Greek religion that Iâm speakinâ of died
out two thousand years ago.â

âThen letâs let it rest in peace,â sez I, âanâ go on with your story.â

âYou understand that this was a fashionable church,â sez Horace. âThey
was willinâ to pay any sum for music anâ fine readinâ anâ all that;
but they wasnât minded to carry out young Carmichaels plan in the
matter of Christianizinâ the world. They was respectable, anâ they
insisted that all who joined in with âem must be respectable, too;
while he discovered that a lot oâ the most persistent sinners wasnât
respectable at all. His theory was, that religion was for the vulgar
sinners, full as much as for the respectable ones; so he made a
round-up anâ wrangled in as choice a lot oâ sinners as a body ever
saw; but his bosses wouldnât stand for his corralinâ âem up in that
fashionable church.

âHe stood out for the sinners; anâ finally they compromised by gettinâ
him a little chapel in the slums, anâ lettinâ him go as far as he
liked with the tough sinners down there through the week; but readinâ
the service on Sundays to the respectable sinners in the big church.
This plan worked smooth as ice, until they felt the need of a soprano
singer who could scrape a little harder againâ the ceilinâ than the
one they already had. Then Carmichael told âem that he had discovered
a girl with a phe-nominal voice, anâ had been teachinâ her music for
some time. He brought her up anâ gave her a trialââ

âAnâ she was the girl, huh?â I interrupted.

âShe had a wonderful voice, all right,â sez Horace, not heedinâ me;
âbut she wasnât as well trained as that church demanded; so they hired
her for twenty-five dollars a Sunday on the condition that she take
lessons from a professor who charged ten dollars an hour. She was
game, though, anâ took the job, anâ made good with it, too, improvinâ
right along until it was discovered that she was singinâ weeknights in
a cafÃ©, from six to eight in the eveninâ, anâ from ten to twelve at
night.

âThe girl had been singinâ with a screen oâ flowers in front of her;
and some oâ the fashionable male sinners from the big church had been
goinâ there right along to hear her sing; but they couldnât work any
plan to get acquainted with her, and this made her a mystery, and drew
âem in crowds. Finally, as her voice got better with the traininâ,
critics admitted âat she could make an agreeable noise; and the common
sinners was tickled to have their judgement backed up, so they began
to brag about it. The result oâ this was, that one olâ weasel had to
swaller his extra-work-at-the-office excuse, and take his own wife to
hear the singer. Then the jig was up. The woman recognized the voice
first pop; and within a week it was known that Carmichael had been
goinâ home with her every night.

âNow, you may be so simple-minded that you donât know it; but really,
this was a perfectly scandalous state of affairs, and the whole
congregation began to buzz like a swarm of angry bees. Carmichael was
as handsome a young feller as was ever seen; but he had never taken
kindly to afternoon teas and such-like functions, which is supposed to
be part of a curateâs duties; so now, when they found he had been
goinâ home nights with a girl âat sang in a cafÃ© it like to have
started an epidemic of hysteria.

âThey found that the girl lived in a poor part oâ the town, and
supported her mother who was sickly, that they were strangers to the
city, and also not minded to furnish much in the way oâ past history.
They insisted upon her givinâ up the cafÃ©-singinâ at once; and from
what Iâve heard, they turned up their noses when they said it.

âCarmichael pointed out that she was givinâ up twenty a week for
lessons which they had insisted upon; and asked âem if they were sure
a girl could be any more, respectable, supportinâ a sickly mother on
five a week, than if she added fifteen to it by singinâ in a cafÃ©. He
got right uppish about it and said right out that he couldnât see
where it was one bit more hellish for her to sing at the cafÃ© than for
other Christians to pay for a chance to listen to her.

âThis tangled âem up in their own ropes considâable; but what finally
settled it was, âat their richest member up and died, and they simply
had to have a sky-scrapinâ soprano to start him off in good style; so
they gave her twenty a week and paid for her lessons. The cafÃ© people
soon found what a card sheâd been and they offered her fifty a week;
but she was game and stuck to the agreement.â

âHow did you find out all this, Horace?â I asked.

âA friend oâ mine belonged to the vestry,â sez Horace; âand he kept me
posted to the minute. This was his first term at it, and it was his
last; but he was a lucky cuss to get the chance just when he did. I
have since won him over to see the beauty oâ the Greek religion.â

âWhat became oâ the girl?â sez I with some impatience, for I didnât
care as much as a single cuss-word for the Greek religion.

âCarmichael was a gentle spoken young feller,â sez Horace, âbut for
all that, he wasnât a doormat by inheritance nor choice, and he kept
on payinâ attention to the girl, and got her to sing at his annex in
the slums. Night after night he filled the place with the best
assortment oâ last-chance sinners âat that locality could furnish; and
he anâ the girl anâ the sinners all pitched in and offered up song
music to make the stars rock; but St. Holiernthou wasnât the sort of a
parish to sit back and let a slum outfit put over as swell a line oâ
melody as they were servinâ, themselves; so they ordered Carmichael to
cut her off his list. He tried to get âem to hire another curate, and
let him have full swing at the annex; but they told him theyâd close
it up first.

âNext, a delegation oâ brave anâ inspired women took it upon âemselves
to call on the girl. They pointed out that she was standinâ in the way
oâ Carmichaelâs career, that, under good conditions, his advance was
certain; but that a false step at the start would ruin it all. They
went on and hinted that if it wasnât for her, he might have married an
heiress, and grow up to be one oâ the leadinâ ministers oâ the whole
country.â

âWhat did she do, Horace?â sez I.

âThe girl was proud; she thanked the delegation for takinâ so much
interest in herâand said that she would not detain âem any longer;
but would think it over as careful as she could. Then she walked out
oâ the room; and the delegation strutted off with their faces shininâ
like a cavey oâ prosperous cats. The girl vanished, just simply
vanished. She wrote Carmichael a letter, and that was the end of it.
Some say she committed suicide, and some say she went to Europe and
became a preemie donnerâa star singerâbut anyway, that was the end
of her, as far as that region was concerned.â

âShe was a fine girl,â sez I; âthough I wish that instead of slippinâ
off that way, she had asked me to drown the members oâ that delegation
as inconspicuous as possible. I wouldnât put on mourninâ, if the whole
outfit of âem was in the same fix your confounded Greek Religion is.
What was her name, Horace?â

âJanet Morris,â sez he.

I said it over a time or two to myself; and it seemed to fit her. âI
like that name,â sez I. âNow tell me the way âat the Friar cut loose
and tied into that vestry. I bet he made trade boom for hospitals and
undertakers.â




CHAPTER FOURTEEN

HAPPYâS NEW AMBITION


Olâ Tank Williams allus maintained that I had a memory like the Lord;
but this ainât so. What I do remember, I actually see in pictures,
just like I told you; but what my memory chooses to discard is as far
out oâ my reach as the smoke oâ last yearâs fire. Iâve worked at my
memory from the day I was weaned, not beinâ enough edicated to know
âat the proper way is to put your memory in a bookâand then not lose
the book. Iâve missed a lot through not gettinâ on friendly terms with
books earlier in life; but then Iâve had a lot oâ fun with my memory
to even things up.

This part about the Friar, though, isnât a fair test. Horaceâs
vestry-man friend was what is known as a short-hand reporter.
Short-hand writinâ is merely a lot oâ dabs and slips whichâd strain a
Chinaman; but Horace said it was as plain to read as print letters,
and as fast to write as spoke words. Hugo took it down right as it was
given; and Horace had a copy which I made him go over with me until I
had scratched it into the hardest part oâ my memory; and now it is
just the same as if I had seen it with my own eyesâme knowinâ every
tone in the Friarâs voice, and the way his eyes shine; yes, and the
way his jaws snap off the words when heâs puttinâ his heart into a
thing.

Horace sat thinkinâ, before he started on with his tale; and I sat
watchinâ his face. It was just all I could do to make out the old
lines which had give me the creeps a few weeks before. Now, it had a
fine, solid tan, the eyes were full oâ fire, and he looked as free
from nerves as a line buckskin. The Friar sez weâre all just bits oâ
glass through which the spirit shines; and now that I had cleaned
Horace up with my nerve treatment, theâ was a right smart of spirit
shininâ out through him, and I warmed my hands at it. He simply could
not learn to roll a cigarette with one hand; but in most things, he
was as able a little chap as ever I took the kinks out of.

âIâm sorry I didnât belong to that vestry,â sez Horace, after a bit.
âWhen I look back at all the sportinâ chances Iâve missed, I feel like
kickinâ myself up to the North Pole and back. From now on I intend to
mix into every bloominâ jambaree âat exposes itself to the vision of
my gaze. Iâm goinâ to ride anâ shoot anâ wrestle anâ box anâ gamble
anâ fight, and get every last sensation Iâm entitled toâbut Iâll
never have another chance at a vestry-meetinâ like the one Iâm about
to tell you of.

âYou saw how toppy Carmichael got this afternoon; so you can guess
purty close how he looked when he lined up this vestry.â

âOh, Iâve seen the Friar in action,â sez I; âand you canât tell me
anything about his style. All you can tell is the details. So go to
âem without wastinâ any more time.â

âHow comes it you call such a man as him Friar Tuck?â asked Horace,
who allus was as hard to drive as an only son burro.

âWell, I donât approve of it,â sez I, âand I kicked about it to the
Friar; but he only laughed, and said âat one name was as good as
another. A bettinâ barber over at Boggs give it to him for admonishinâ
a gambler from Cheyenne.â

âWas he severe?â asked Horace.

âDepends on how you look at it,â sez I. âHe took a club away from the
gambler anâ spanked him with it; but he didnât injure him a mite.â

âHumph,â sez Horace, âI guess the name wonât rust much while itâs in
his keepinâ. He took other methods at this vestry meetinâ, though I
donât say they were any more befittinâ. Hugoâsuch was the name of my
friendâsaid it was the quietest, but the most dramatic thing he ever
saw.

âThey started in by treatinâ him like the boy he was, gave him a lot
oâ copy-book advice, especially as to the value oâ patience, how that
Paul was to do the plantinâ, Appolinaris, the waterinâ; but that the
size anâ time oâ the harvest depended on the Lord, Himself; and that
it was vanity to think âat a young boy just out oâ college could rush
things through the way he was tryinâ to.

âTheâ was a hurt look about Carmichaelâs eyes; but the hurt had come
from the letter, not from them, so he sat quiet and smiled down at âem
in a sort of super-human calmness. They thought he was bluffed
speechless, so they girded up their loins, anâ tied into him a little
harder, tellinâ him that his conduct in walkinâ home nights with a
cafÃ©-singer was little short of immoral, although they wouldnât make
no pointed charge againâ the woman herself. Then they wound up by
sayinâ âat they feared he was too young to spend so much time amid the
environs oâ sin, and that they would put an older man in charge oâ the
annex, and this would leave him free to attend strictly to cu-ratinâ.

âWhen they had spoke their piece, they were all beaminâ with the
upliftinâ effect of it; and they settled back with beautiful smiles oâ
satisfaction to listen to Carmichaelâs thanks and repentance. He sat
there smilinâ tooânot smilinâ the brand oâ smiles âat they were, but
still smilinâ. It would strain a dictionary to tell all there is in
some smiles.

âPresently he rose up, swept his eyes over âem for a time, and said in
a low tone: âThen I am to understand that I am to follow in the
Masterâs footsteps only as far as personal chastity goes?â said he.
âThat I may respectably pity the weak and sinful from a distance; but
must not dismount from my exalted pedestal to take âem by the hand anâ
lift âem upâIs that what you mean?â sez he.

âThey still thought he was whipped, so one of âem pulled a little
sarcasm on him: âTakinâ the weak anâ sinful by the hand anâ liftinâ
âem up is all right,â said he; âbut itâs not necessary to go home with
âem after midnight.â

âCarmichael bit his lips; he tried to hold himself down, he honestly
tried for some time; but he wasnât quite able. His hands trembled anâ
his lip trembled while he was fightinâ himself; but when he kicked off
his hobbles anâ sailed into âem, his tremblinâ stopped anâ the words
shot forth, clear anâ hot anâ bitish. Hugo sat back in a corner durinâ
this meetinâ, without speakinâ a single word; and he was glad of it.
It saved him from gettinâ his feelinâs kicked into flinders about him,
anâ interferinâ with the view; and it gave him a chance to take his
notes.

ââAs a matter oâ faith,â said Carmichael, âwe believe that Jesus never
sinned; but we cannot know this as a matter of fact. Yet we can know,
and we do know, as a matter of history, that He mingled anâ had
fellowship with the fallen, the sinful, the outcast, and the
disreputable. With these He lived, and with these and for these He
left the power and the life and the glory of His religionâand you say
that I must live in a glass case, may only look in holy dignity down
at the weak and sinful; but that I mustnât go home with âem after
midnight. With God, a thousand years is but as a dayâand yet it would
be wrong for me to be in a sinnerâs company after midnight!â

âCarmichael paused here to give âem a comeback at him; but their
mouths were dry, and they only hemmed anâ hawed. âEvery Sunday, in the
service of this refined anâ respectable church, hunderds of you admit
that you have no health because of your sinsâand yet, because of my
youth, you say I must remain with you where sin is robed in silk and
broadcloth, and not risk my soul where sin is robed in rags.â

âHe paused again, and this time his eyes began to shoot
jerk-lightning, anâ when he started to speak his deep voice shook the
room like the low notes of a big organ. âNo,â he said, âI am not
content to walk with the Lord, only on the day of His triumphâThe
very ones who strewed the pathway of His majesty with palms, and
filled the air with hosaners, deserted Him at the crossâbut I must
walk with Him every step of the way. I do not pray that my earthly
garments be spotless, I do not pray that my sandals be unworn anâ free
from mud; but I do pray that when I stand on my own Calvery I may
stand with those who bear crosses, not with those who have spent their
lives in learninâ to wear crowns.â

âCarmichael had discarded that entire vestry by this time, and he
didnât care a blue-bottle fly what they thought of him. He towered
above them with his face shininâ, and his voice rolled down over âem
like a Norther sweepinâ through the hills. âMany there were,â he went
on, âwho cried to Him, Lord, Lord; but after the tomb was sealed, it
was the Magdalene whose faith never faltered, it was to her He first
appeared; and on the final resurrection morning, I hope the lesser
Magdalenes of all the ages, and from all the nasty corners of the
world into which manâs greed has crowded âem, will know that I am
their brother, and, save for a lovinâ hand at the right moment, one of
them to the last sordid detail.â

âCarmichael stopped after this, and the room was so quiet you could
hear the consciences oâ that vestry floppinâ up and down againâ their
pocketbooks. When he began again his voice was soft, anâ the
bitterness had given way to sadness. âThe old way was best, after
all,â he said. âWhen you pay a priest a salary, you hire him and he
becomes your servant. The custom is, for masters to dictate to their
servants; it is an old, old custom, and hard to break. I think I could
suit you; but I do not think I shall try. The roots of my own life
lead back to the gutter, and through these roots shall I draw strength
to lift others from the gutter. I do not value my voice as a means to
amuse those already weary of amusement: I look upon it as a tool to
help clean up the world. You are already so clean that you fear I may
defile you by contagion. You do not need me; and with all your careful
business methods, you have not money enough to hire me.

ââWhat you need here, is a diplomat; while I yearn to be on the firmâ
line. I care little for the etiquette of religion, I want to get down
where the fightinâ is fierce anâ primitiveâso I hereby resign.

ââThis girl whom you have driven out of my life, needs no defence from
me or any man. I have known her since she was a little child; poverty
was her lot, and self-sacrifice has become her second nature. We are
forbidden to judge; so I judge neither her nor you; but I will say
that often I have stood silent before the beauty of her character, and
often my face has burned at the tainted money you have put on the
plate. Part of this money comes from the rental of dives. I have seen
the dives themselves, I have seen their fearful product; and I cannot
believe that profit wrung from a helpless slave can find its way to
Godâeven on the contribution plate.

ââI love the music anâ the service anâ the vestments oâ this church;
and I hope I need not give them up; but my heart is in rebellion, and
from this time on I take the full responsibility of my acts. I shall
not choose my path; but will go as the spirit moves me; and if ever I
find one single spot which seems too dark for the Light of the world
to enter, then shall the soul in me shrivel and die, and I shall
become a beast, howling in the jungle.ââ

Horace said that after the Friar had left the room, those vestry
fellers sat in a sort of daze for some time, and then got up anâ
sneaked out one at a time, lookinâ exceeding thoughtful; while Hugo
had hustled around to his room to read off his notes.

We sat there on the hill until dark, me tryinâ to pump him for more
details, but he didnât have âem. He said the Friar had started to work
in the slums; but was soon lost sight of, and the first he had heard
of him for years was when he had come up the pass, singinâ his
marchinâ song. Course, Iâd liked it some better if the Friar had
knocked their heads together; but still, takinâ his eyes anâ voice
into consideration, it must âaâ been a fine sight; and if ever I get
the chance, Iâm goinâ to take on as a vestry-man, myself, for at least
one term.




CHAPTER FIFTEEN

TENDER FEELINGS


Me anâ Horace was regular chums after this. I had got to likinâ him
after he had showed up good stuff under treatment; but I never took
him serious until he got enthusiastic about Friar Tuck. This proved
him to have desirable qualities and made him altogether worth while. A
man never gets too old to dote on flattery; but the older he gets the
more particular he is about its quality. Itâs just like tobacco anâ
pie anâ whiskey anâ such things: we start out hungry for âem anâ take
a lot oâ trouble to get âem in quantity; but after a time weâd sooner
go without altogether than not to have a superior article; anâ itâs
just the same way with flattery.

I took Horace into my most thoughtful moods as soon as I found out
that he was as sound as a nut at heart, anâ that it wasnât altogether
his fault that he had been a pest to me at first. The human mind is
like new land, some of itâs rich anâ some poor. Facts is like manure,
idees is like seed, anâ education is like spadinâ up anâ hoeinâ anâ
rakinâ. Rich soil is bound to raise somethinâ, even if itâs nothinâ
but weeds; but poor soil needs special care, or it wonât even raise
weeds. Now, manure can be put on so thick it will turn ground sour,
anâ seeds can be sowed so thick they will choke each other, anâ a
green hand will sometimes hoe up the vegetables anâ cultivate the
weeds; but the soil ainât to blame for this.

Poor Horaceâs mind had been bungled to an infernal degree; anâ it kept
me busy rootinâ up sprouts oâ Greek religion. Iâd have stood this
better if the Greek gods anâ godduses had had Christian names; âcause
I own up âat some oâ his tales of âem was interestinâ; but I couldnât
keep track of âem, anâ so I made him discard âem in his conversations
with me; anâ the way he flattered me was, to reform himself accordinâ
to what I demanded.

I was teachinâ him how to shoot, anâ he was enjoyinâ it a lot. He had
plenty oâ money, and took pleasure in spendinâ it. This was good,
âcause it costs a lot oâ money to become a good shot. Iâm glad I donât
know what it cost me to learn how to shoot a man through both ears
after doinâ the double reverse roll. I never had but one fit chance to
use this, anâ then I shot Frenchy through his ears without rememberinâ
to use the roll. I allus felt bad about this, âcause I had a good
audience, anâ nothinâ saves a man from the necessity oâ shootinâ his
fellows, so much as havinâ it well advertised that he is thoroughly
qualified to do it in proper style. I kept up my own practicinâ while
teachinâ Horace, anâ we had right sociable times.

He could throw up a tin can with his left hand, pull his gun and,
about once out oâ ten shots, hit the can before it fell; which is
purty fair shootinâ; but he was beginninâ to suspect that he was a
regular gun-man; which is a dangerous idee for any one to get into his
head. I tried to weight down his head a little to keep him sensible,
but instead oâ thankinâ me he went off with Tank, who shot up a lot of
his cartridges at target practice; and in return, puffed up the
top-heavy opinion Horace already had of himself.

He took Horace down to a warm caÃ±on where theâ was a lot oâ
rattlesnakes, claiminâ it was necessary to test him out anâ see if he
had nerve on a livinâ creature. He shot off the heads oâ three snakes,
hand-runninâ, anâ it nearly broke his hatband.

When he told me about it, I let him know âat Tank was only workinâ
him. âA rattlesnake will strike at a flash, Horace,â sez I; âanâ it
was the snakeâs eyes which were accurate, not yours.â This cut him up
anâ made him a little offish with me for a few days, until he found I
had told him the truth. Olâ Tank Williams wasnât no fancy shot; but
Iâd rather have tackled Horace with a gun, cocked in his hand, than
olâ Tank, with his gun asleep in its holster.

After Horace had made the test of shootinâ at dead snakes anâ had
found that he couldnât pop off three heads hand-runninâ, he simmered
down a little anâ paid more heed to what I told him; but after I had
proved that I told him straighter stuff ân Tank did, I decided it
would be necessary to punish him a little. I didnât get downright cold
with him, because I didnât want to exaggerate his vanity any more ân
it already was; but I made it a point to do my loafinâ with Spider
Kelley. Horace was crazy to go bear-huntinâ; but I didnât seem
interested, anâ I recommended olâ Tank Williams as beinâ some the best
bear-hunter theâ was in existence. I wasnât jealous of Horace goinâ
off shootinâ with Tank; but still if a feller chooses to dispense with
my company, I allus like to show him âat I can stand it as long as he
can.

Quite a string oâ years had slipped away since the bettinâ barber oâ
Boggs had strung olâ man Dort; so I reminded Spider âat we had agreed
to help even that up sometime; and Spider, he said he was ready to do
his part, whatever it happened to be; so we planned idees out among
ourselves, while Horace hung around lookinâ wishful.

We had never given it away about the woodchuck not beinâ a regular
squirrel; so the boys still used to congregate together purty often at
olâ man Dortâs to marvel at the way Columbus had filled out anâ took
on flesh. He had got rough anâ blotchy soon after he had won the
contest from Ben Butler, the red squirrel, anâ it was plain to all
that Eugene had done some high-toned barberinâ on him before the day
oâ the show.

Olâ man Dort didnât have no affection for Columbusâfact is, he sort
oâ hated him for beinâ bigger ân Ben Butler; but he kept him fat anâ
fit so as to be ready to enter in a contest the minute any feller came
along with a squirrel he thought was big enough to back up with a bet.
The trouble was, that mighty few fellers out that way owned any
squirrels, anâ as the years dragged by without him gettinâ any pastime
out oâ Columbus, olâ man Dortâs affection for him grew thinner anâ
thinner. Some oâ the boys discovered him to be a woodchuck; but no one
told of it for fear the old man would slaughter Eugene.

The old man kept on gettinâ barbered, so as to have the chance oâ
clashinâ with Eugene about every subject which came up; but finally he
got so he could be shaved in a decent, orderly manner without havinâ
his head tied down to the rest. Him anâ Eugene was the most
antagonistic fellers I ever met up with; but it was a long time before
me anâ Spider could think up a way to get âem fairly at it again.

One day Spider came ridinâ in from Danders, bubblinâ over with
excitement, and yells outââPete Peabodyâs got a freak guinea-pig.â

âThatâs glorious news,â sez I. âLetâs get all the boys together anâ
hold a celebration.â

âI guess a freak guinea-pigâs as worthy oâ beinâ commented on as airy
other kind of freak,â sez Spider, stridinâ off to the corral, purty
well pouted up.

He hadnât more ân reached it before an idee reached me, anâ I ran
after him. âWhat is theâ freakish about this guinea-pig, Spider?â sez
I.

âHeâs got a tail,â snapped Spider.

âAinât they all got tails?â sez I.

âYou know they ainât,â he sez. âYou remember what that feller from the
East said last springâif you hold up a guinea-pig by the tail, his
eyes fall out, anâ then when we didnât believe it, he told us they
didnât have no tails. Pete sez that this guinea-pig is the only one in
the world what has a tail.â

âDo you reckon heâd sell it?â

âHeâd sell the hair off his head,â sez Spider.

âWell, you go back there anââBut say, has Pete got any others?â

âHe had ten when I left, anâ no knowinâ how many heâs got by this
time. Pete sez âat guinea-pigs is the prolificest things theâ is,â sez
Spider.

âYou buy three of âem, Spider,â sez I; âa male one anâ a female one,
anâ this here freak.â

âWhat do I want with âem?â sez Spider.

âIâll pay half, anâ show you how to make money out of âem,â sez I.

âI donât want to tinker with no such cattle as them,â sez Spider.

âYou get a fresh pony, anâ it wonât take you no time at all,â sez I.

So Spider got the pony anâ went off grumblinâ. When he brought âem
back he had âem in a small box anâ they certainly was curious lookinâ
insects. âI paid four bits apiece for the male anâ the female,â sez
Spider, âanâ twenty-five real dollars for the freak.â

âIf thatâs the way prices run,â sez I, âit ainât no wonder that
guinea-pigs what are ambitious to be popular, are willinâ to give up
the luxury oâ tails.â

âNow then, what in thunder are we goinâ to do with âem?â sez Spider.

âGet a fresh pony,â sez I, âanâ weâll go on over to Boggs.â

âYou go to the equator!â yells Spider. âI ainât had no sleep for a
week.â

âSleep,â sez I, âwhatâs the use oâ botherinâ about sleep? You keep on
losinâ your strength this way, anâ in about a year theyâll be
trundlinâ you around in a baby cart. All right then, you stay home anâ
be company for the freak. Weâll hide him up in the attic so the rats
canât get him.â

âOh I could stand it to go without sleep, if I saw any sense in it,â
sez Spider; âbut hanged if Iâm goinâ to ride my bones through my skin
just to please you.â

âSuit yourself,â sez I. âWeâll put the freak in the tin cake-box anâ
punch a few holes in it to give him air. Iâll do that while youâre
makinâ up your mind about goinâ along to Boggs.â

âWhat you goinâ to do with the male anâ the female?â sez Spider as I
started away.

âIâm goinâ to sell âem to Eugene,â I calls back over my shoulder, anâ
then I knew Iâd have company.

âI thought you was goinâ to Boggs,â sez Spider as soon as we had
settled into a travelinâ trot. I allus find that I get along easier
with people if I just leave âem one or two items to puzzle over.

âWebb Station is closer,â sez I; âanâ if this deal causes any hard
feelinâ it will be just as well not to be mixed up in it ourselves.â

âI thought you was goinâ to sell these to Eugene?â sez Spider.

âIf youâd just go to sleep, Spider,â sez I, âit would save your brain
the trouble oâ thinkinâ up a lot oâ thoughts which ainât no use
anyhow. Iâm goinâ to let Shorty take âem over this eveninâ anâ sell
âem to Eugene.â

âHow do you know he wants âem?â

ââCause I know Eugene,â sez I. âIâll fix up Shortyâs tale for him.â

Well, we explained to Shorty the bettinâ principle of guinea-pigs, anâ
gave him the pigs, tellinâ him he could have all he won from Eugene on
the first bet; but to then sell âem to Eugene without lettinâ any oâ
the other fellers know anything about it, anâ to make Eugene think
that he had picked âem up from a train passenger, not from us.

Shorty said that heâd go over that afternoon as soon as the passenger
had goneâShorty was the telegraph operatorâso Spider anâ I came
back, he sleepinâ all the way.

âWhere do we come in on this deal?â sez Spider next day.

âWeâll give Eugene a chance to cut their hair a new way, anâ then
weâll go over to Boggs anâ line things up.â

âIâm beginninâ to see how it could be worked out,â sez Spider,
grinninâ.

In about a week we went over to Boggs, anâ found the town purty well
deserted. We dropped into olâ man Dortâs to compliment Columbus some
anâ sympathize with Ben Butler a little, while tryinâ to hear if
Eugene had made his play yet. The olâ man was gloatinâ over the fact
that Eugene wasnât havinâ much trade, but he didnât mention anything
about guinea-pigs.

âYou donât seem rushed, yourself,â sez I.

âCourse I ainât,â he flares back. âMost oâ the fellers are still
roundinâ up, anâ the rest are out huntinâ for Red Erickson.â

âRed been gettinâ thoughtless again?â sez I. Red Erickson was a big
Dane who had the habit oâ runnin off stock anâ shootinâ any one who
disagreed with him.

The olâ man merely pointed to a paper pinned up on the wall offerinâ
fifteen hundred dollars for Red, dead or alive. He hadnât been
operatinâ on Diamond Dot stuff, so we hadnât paid much heed to him.

We strolled on over to Eugeneâs anâ found him sittinâ down anâ talkinâ
about the peculiar custom oâ guinea-pigs; so we knew that he had
swallered the bait; but he didnât offer to bet with us.

Then we went back anâ asked olâ man Dort if he believed that a
guinea-pigâs eyes would fall out if he was held up by the tail.

âItâs all rot!â sez the olâ man, indignant. âAny one who sez such
nonsense never studied the way eyes is fastened in. The tail ainât got
nothinâ to do with it.â

âWhat kind oâ tails has guinea-pigs got?â sez I.

âWhy they gotâ?â sez the olâ man, anâ then stopped anâ looked blank.
âWhat kind oâ tails have they got?â

âThey havenât got any,â sez I. âNow listen; would you be willinâ to
risk a little money to even up with Eugene?â

âIâd risk every thing I got, down to my very hide,â sez the olâ man,
earnest to a degree.

âWell, then, you play careful anâ weâll provide you with the cards,â
sez I. âEugene has some guinea-pigs, anâ he is planninâ to string you
on a bet. You come right along just as though you was as ignorant as
you look, have a day fixed to decide the bet, let us know, anâ for the
small sum of fifty dollars weâll provide you with a guinea-pig which
has a tail.â

âIâll make a pauper out of him,â sez the olâ man. âI havenât had a
chance to get a bet on Columbus since I owned him.â

âYou just land Eugene,â sez I, âanâ thatâll be sport enough for one
while.â

âI got shaved twice to-day,â sez the olâ man feelinâ his chin, ââcause
we got into a discussion about comets; but I reckon I can stand
another to-morrow.â

The next day the old man asked Eugene what all kind oâ game grew in
Africa. âElephants, hippopotamusses anâ guinea-pigs,â sez Eugene.

âGuinea-pigs?â sez the olâ man.

âYes, theyâre the most curious animals theâ is in existence,â sez
Eugene.

âHow big are they?â asked olâ man Dort. He hadnât an idea in the
world, anâ was beginninâ to think that if they sized up with elephants
anâ hippopotamusses, he didnât want to have to lift one by the tail to
win his bet.

âThey ainât any bigger ân young rabbits,â sez Eugene, stroppinâ his
razor; âbut the curious part of âem is that if you hold up one by the
tail, his eyesâll drop out.â

âIâll bet a hundred dollars they wouldnât do it,â sez the olâ man.

âThatâs a safe enough bet,â sez Eugene, calm anâ easy. âTheyâre worth
all the way up to five hundred dollars a pair, anâ it ainât likely
that a man would invest that amount in something, just to win a
hundred-dollar bet.â

They sparred back anâ forth for a couple oâ days until finally Eugene
bet nine hundred in cashâall he had in the worldâanâ his shop anâ
fixinâs, againâ eleven hundred dollars, that the old man couldnât lift
a guinea-pig by the tail without his eyes fallinâ out. If the olâ man
didnât lift one by the tail, he lost the bet. They set the date for a
week ahead, anâ the olâ man bet Eugene three hundred dollars that heâd
win the bet, takinâ Eugeneâs promissory agreement for his end of it.

We brought in the freak the day before the contest anâ the olâ manâs
eyes lit up when he see the tail. It wasnât much of a tail at that;
but it was a sure enough tail anâ plenty long enough to lift him by,
anâ strong enough too, anâ theâ was regular bones in it, just like any
tail.

Theâ was only a fair sized crowd of us on hand to see the test; but
Eugene went through all the preliminaries, anâ then took the cover off
his box anâ pointed to the guinea-pigs. He had shaved the parts of âem
where tails naturally belong, anâ when the boys see that they didnât
have no tails, they howled with laughter anâ began to hoot olâ man
Dort; anâ Eugene confided to âem the plans he had for spendinâ the
money heâd won.

Olâ man Dort, he walked calmly up to the box, examined the
guinea-pigs, anâ sez: âThese here is not the full-blooded guinea-pigs.
The full-blooded ones live in a mountainous? country anâ use their
tails to steer with when they jump from rock to rock; while this kind
live in swamps anâ the young alligators keep on eatinâ off their tails
until they donât have any. Iâll go get a thoroughbred anâ do my
liftinâ on him.â

Well this set âem back a good ways; anâ as the olâ man was walkinâ off
to get his own speciment, a good many bets was put up, but Eugene
didnât take any.

Purty soon, back come the olâ man; anâ hanged if he hadnât clipped the
hair off oâ his oneâs tail too. He reached in his hand anâ stroked the
long-faced little duffer, anâ sez: âGently, George the Third, gently.â
Then he put on an anxious look anâ picked up the guinea-pig by the
tail, holdinâ his other hand underneath to catch any eyes what
happened to spill out. They didnât none drop out, anâ the crowd give a
cheer; but Eugene was all in.

He was a bad loser was Eugene, anâ he didnât join in the festivities
any. He just took up his two guineas anâ went back to his shop, while
the rest of us celebrated a few. After a time me anâ Spider went to
console with him a little. He was so infernally down in the mouth that
I began to get a little conscience-struck. Eugene said he had been
savinâ up his money to pay off the mortgage on his birthplace; anâ he
made a purty sad story out of it. Fact was, that he made so sad a
story out of it that I decided to get him back his tools and give him
a new start.




CHAPTER SIXTEEN

THEMIS IN THE ROCKIES


âHow much money you got, Spider?â I sez.

âI reckon I got sixty dollars,â sez Spider.

âI donât mean just what you got with ya, I mean how much cash do you
possess in the world.â

âI suppose I could raise a hundred anâ fifteen,â sez Spider, after
thinkinâ a while. âWhat do you want to know for?â

âWe got to give Eugene a start,â sez I.

Spider looked at me until he saw I was in earnest, anâ then he talked
out loud. âWhatâs the matter with you?â he yells. âWe havenât adopted
Eugene, have we? Why-for do we have to give him a start? Didnât he
lose at his own game. Great Snakes! You make me tired!â

âThat was a low-down trick we played,â sez I.

âIt wasnât no lower down ân him ringinâ in a woodchuck on the old man;
and all we did it for was to square things up.â

âYes,â sez I; âbut it took us some several years to square it up, and
I donât intend to have Eugeneâs moanful voice surginâ through my ears
until Iâm able to think up a come-back for him. Iâm goinâ to give him
a start, and if you donât feel like riskinâ your money, Iâll do it
alone.â

âDo you mean âat youâre just goinâ to pay over the price of his tools,
anâ let it go at that?â sez Spider.

âThat wouldnât be any fun,â sez I. âIâm goinâ to get the tools; but I
intend to get âem for as little expense as possible, and if I can have
a little fun out of it, I donât intend to pass it up.â

Spider studied it over a while. âWell, Iâll risk fifty,â he sez after
a bit; so we went back to Eugeneâs.

âWould you be willinâ to do a stunt to get back your tools?â sez I.

He raised a pair oâ weepy eyes to me anâ sez: âAw, theâ ainât no show.
Iâve a good mind to kill myself.â

âPlease donât do that,â sez Spider, who never could stand a bad loser.
âWhen you lose your money, you allus stand a chance to win more money;
but when you lose your life, why, theâ ainât nothinâ left except to go
up anâ find out what reward it earned for you.â

âAw hell,â muttered Eugene.

âYe-es,â agreed Spider, talkinâ through his nose, like a missionary
preacher, âI reckon that is about what youâd draw, if you was to cash
in now; but if you stick around anâ do your duty, you run the risk oâ
havinâ better luck later on.â

After Spider had insulted Eugene until he began to sass back a little,
I broke in and sez that if Eugene will agree to do what I tell him,
Iâll agree to get him back his outfit; so then he wants to know what I
have in mind.

âAre you willinâ to disguise yourself as a genuwine mountain trapper?â
sez I.

When I sez this, Spider exploded a laugh which would âaâ hurt the
feelinâs of a sheep, and Eugene tied into us as wordy as a fox
terrier; but I soothed him down anâ told him I was in earnest. âIâm
willinâ to do most anything to get my tools back,â sez Eugene; âbut I
donât see how I can make myself look like a genuwine trapper.â

âHave you got any false wigs and beards?â sez I.

âNo, I havenât,â sez he; âbut I saved up the stuff I reaped off oâ olâ
man Dort, and I reckon I could make some.â

âThe very thing!â sez I. âYou fix up a rig thatâll make you look to be
a hundred years old; and weâll hunt up clothes for ya. All youâll have
to do will be to guide a green Eastener out to shoot a bear, and weâll
have the bear and everything ready for ya.â

âNo, ya donât,â sez Eugene. âI donât fool around no bears.â

âI thought you was tired oâ life,â sez Spider.

âWell, Iâm not so tired of it that Iâm willinâ to have it squeezed out
oâ me by a bear,â sez Eugene.

âThis wonât be a real bear,â sez I; âand anyhow, theyâll be a ravine
between you and it. You claimed once to be a show actor, and all
youâll have to do will be to pertend âat youâre actinâ.â

âI once was a genuwine amateur actor,â sez Eugene, âand if youâll make
it clear to me that there ainât no danger, Iâll take the job.â

Then I explained just what he had to do; and after this me anâ Spider,
who was now keen for the outcome, went around to dicker with olâ man
Dort. He was bumpinâ around among the clouds, so we didnât have any
trouble in buyinâ back Eugeneâs stuff on time. When I asked him what
heâd charge for Columbus, the woodchuck, he gave a snort, and said
heâd throw him in for good measure; so I told him to just keep him out
oâ sight for a few days, and we started back to Eugeneâs.

âWhat do you want with that dog-gone woodchuck?â asked Spider.

âI want him to take the part of a grizzly bear,â sez I.

Spider stopped anâ looked at me. âThis is goinâ too far,â sez he.
âItâs bad enough to try to fool some one into believinâ âat Eugeneâs a
genuwine trapper; but you couldnât make a rag doll believe âat
Columbus was a grizzly bear.â

âYou go borrow that squaw dress from Ike Spargle, anâ then weâll see
how much like a trapper Eugeneâll look,â sez I.

I went on anâ found âat Eugene had done a master job oâ wig makinâ,
even fixinâ false eyebrows, anâ when he put on olâ man Dortâs
hair-crop he locked older ân the human race. As soon as Spider came in
with the squaw dress, we put it on Eugene; and while he didnât look
like anything Iâd ever seen before, he looked more like the first man
âat ever started trappinâ than like anything else, anâ Spider Kelley
nearly had a convulsion.

We bunked with Eugene that night; but he kept us awake bemoaninâ his
cruel fate until Spider threatened to drown him head first in a bucket
oâ water and after that we had a little go at slumberinâ. I routed âem
out about two anâ drilled âem up to the high ground above Spear Crick,
where we waited until sun-up. Eugene was wearinâ his trapper rigginâ,
and in the starlight, he sure was a ghastly sight.

Just across from us on the other side oâ the crick was Sholteâs Knoll,
and when the sun rose, I lined us up to be just in a direct line with
it across the knoll. Both Eugene, and Spider bothered me with
questions and discouraginâ kicks; but I felt purty sure my scheme
would work, and only told âem what was really for their good.

The crick ran south in a gorge, and just below us it ran into Rock
River, which came from the east and made a sharp turn to the south
just where Spear Crick ran into it. After the sun was up, we climbed
down a circlinâ trail until we came to Rock River. Eugene refused to
try to ford it; but Spider and I went across and up to Ivanâs Knoll.
Rock River was bigger than Spear Crick, and Ivanâs Knoll was bigger
than Sholteâs Knoll; but not one tenderfoot in a million could have
told âem apart, and Spider got gleeful at the planâexcept that he
kept at me to know who I was tryinâ to land. Back of Ivanâs Knoll was
a round hole about ten feet across, called the Bottomless Pit, because
theâ was no bottom to it. After examininâ this place, we went on and
crossed Rock River again until we came out at Sholteâs Knoll across
from where the shootinâ was to be done.

âWhat you are to do, Spider,â sez I, âis to be at this place before
dawn with Columbus tied by a stout cord. Tie him to the rock at the
south end of the knoll by a weak cord, then pass your stout cord up
over that jag oâ rock at the top, and just as soon as the sun hits the
knoll, pull hard enough to break the weak cord, lead him gently up the
slope until he has been shot at several times, thenââ

âIs Eugene, that genuwine, ancient trapper goinâ to do the shootinâ?â
interrupted Spider.

âHe is not,â sez I. âIf Columbus gets shot, all youâll have to do will
be to wind around to Boggs and meet me there. If he donât get shot,
you can either turn him adrift, kill him yourself, or pack him back to
olâ man Dortâs, accordinâ to the dictates oâ your own conscience. Iâll
bring the party âat does the shootinâ up to Ivanâs Knoll, anâ make him
think the bear has fallen down the Bottomless Pit after he was shot.â

âHappy,â sez Spider, âhanged if I believe itâll go through; and I
wonât be a sucker unless you tell me who is to do the shootinâ.â

âHorace,â sez I, âHorace Walpole Bradford.â

Spiderâs face changed expression a half dozen times in two moments;
but he didnât have any more kicks; so we went back to Eugene, and took
him up to a deserted cabin, where he was to stay until needed. I left
him and Spider to fix up the cabin, while I went back to the Dot to
fix up Horace. Horace had a lot oâ money; but it did go againâ me to
make him pay for Eugeneâs outfit by puttinâ up a practical joke on
him. Still, I felt called upon to square it up with Eugene, and this
seemed the fairest way.

When I reached the Dot, Horace came forth to meet me; and he was so
glad to see me âat I purtâ nigh gave up the scheme; but I had gone too
far to back out now, so I acted cool, and cut him short with my
answers.

After supper I got Tank started on bear. He saw I had something up my
sleeve, so he talked bear until Horaceâs mouth began to water. âIâd
give a hundred dollars, just to get a shot at a bear,â sez Horace.

âThis ainât the time oâ the year to hunt bear,â sez I. âFoodâs so
common at this season that a bear spends most of his time loafinâ; and
itâs hard to get sight oâ one. Course, if you was to go to a
professional hunter, heâd know where bears were spendinâ their
vacation; but it might take a month for one of us to root one out.â

âDo you know of any professional hunters?â sez he.

I didnât say nothinâ, and Tank told of some he knew several hundred
miles off. After Tank had talked himself out, I mentioned careless
like that old Pierre La Blanc was livinâ less ân twenty miles away;
but that I doubted if heâd take a bear-huntinâ job. I went on to state
that he had money saved up, and it would take a sight oâ coin to tempt
him.

âIâd give five hundred dollars for a shot at a real grizzly,â sez
Horace.

âDid you ever use a rifle?â sez I.

âAsk Tank,â sez Horace.

Tank told about Horace havinâ borrowed olâ Cast Steelâs
forty-five-seventy, and that he had learned to hit a mark with it in
able shape. Before we turned in that night, I had let Horace tease me
into takinâ him over to Pierreâs next day.

We reached the old cabin next afternoon, and found it lookinâ purty
comfortable. Eugene had soiled his hands and what part of his face
showed; and he certainly did look outlandish. He could act some, Iâll
say that for him; and he pertended so natural that it took Tank a half
hour to tell who he was. He didnât talk much, but when he did he used
broken French, and he made a contract with Horace to get the five
hundred as soon as he had showed him the bear, Tank to hold the check.

Eugene couldnât get food through his whiskers; so he said most of his
teeth were gone, and et his supper in private. After supper, I stole
down the gulch and found Spider waitinâ. He promised to be on hand the
next morninâ and we turned in early.

Next morninâ we started at three, and took up our place at the mark I
had made across from Sholteâs Knoll. Horace thought it perfectly
wonderful that the old trapper would know exactly where a grizzly bear
would be at sun-up; and he chattered constant in a hushed voice. We
told him it was a full quarter across to the knoll, and he had a
regular ecstasy about how deceivinâ the atmosphere wasâwhich was rank
libel, the atmosphere beinâ about the least deceivinâ member oâ that
party.

Presently, I caught the smell oâ dawn, and I told Horace to keep his
eyes glued on Chimney Peak, a little over twenty miles to the west. He
did so, and in about five minutes, a gob oâ rich crimson splashed on
it, rippled down the sides, and poured along the foothills at the
bottom. Horace gave a gasp. You donât see such a dawn as that with
your eyes alone; you see it with somethinâ inside your bosom; and when
I saw the gleam in Horaceâs eyes, it made me feel ashamed of what I
was up to; but I couldnât stop just for this; so I nudged Eugene, and
that hoary old trapper growled out to Horace to watch the knoll, or
heâd miss his chance.

Horace was surprised to see the east still in a black shadow. He
started to speak words about it, but just then the sun, lookinâ like
an acre of red fire, jumped up from behind Sholteâs Knoll like a
sacred jack-rabbit.

The knoll was considâable higher than us, and just as the sun was
half-circle behind it, a gigantic form started to walk across it from
south to north. I knew, positive, that this was Columbus the
woodchuck; but it was just all I could do to believe it, myself, and
Horace thought it was the biggest silver-tip in creation. I didnât
think the woodchuck ran much risk of gettinâ shot; but Horace didnât
lose his nerve a particle. He banged away, Columbus gave a lurch, took
a snap at his side, and rolled out oâ sight behind the knoll, as
natural as a fried egg.

Horace jumped up and down, hugged himself, slapped us on the back, and
almost knocked the aged trapperâs fur off; but if he had, I doubt if
he would have noticed it, he was so eager to get to his first bear.

We wound down the path, and he complained about it beinâ so much
farther ân he had expected; but I spoke a few words about the
atmosphere, and he was soothed. When we struck Rock River, he was
surprised to see how much wider it was than it looked from where heâd
shot; but he didnât falter none about goinâ in; while I purtâ nigh had
to twist off the seasoned trapperâs arm before heâd get his feet wet.
The water was purty high, and Tank and I had our hands full gettinâ
âem across.

We climbed the trail on the other side to Ivanâs Knoll. This was about
a mile south oâ Sholteâs Knoll, and naturally I didnât expect to find
any game on the other side of it; so you can judge my feelinâs when we
got around to the other side, and saw that woodchuckâs carcass, lyinâ
flat on its back with its front feet folded across a piece oâ paper.

Horace saw it, too; but he wasnât interested at first, and dove all
about, lookinâ for his bear. He was plumb wild; but finally he picked
up the piece oâ paper, and read what was wrote on it in scrawly
letters, which I knew to be the work oâ Spider Kelley: âBefore I was
shot I was a grizzly bar but it made me feel so small to get shot by a
tender-foot that I have shrank to what you see befor you.â

That confounded Kelley hadnât been able to resist workinâ the joke
back on me; so he had toted Columbus down from Sholteâs Knoll, and
then skipped. I knew I wouldnât see him for some timeâbut I also knew
I wouldnât forget what was cominâ to him when I did.

Horace read the note through in silence, then he looked at the remains
of the woodchuck, then he read the note again, and his face got like a
sunset. He read the note once more, and then he leaped through the air
for that veteran trapper, and grabbed him by the beard. The beard and
wig came off in his hands, and Eugene started to flee, with Horace a
close second, kickinâ the seat oâ that squaw dress at every jump.
Horace was in able shape, and Eugene was flimsy; so when he tripped
and rolled over, Horace got him by the ears, and proceeded to beat his
head on a stone, the way Tank had told about doinâ to the unobliginâ
old miner.

I pulled Horace off to save Eugeneâs life, and then Horace pulled out
a gun and tried to take my life. It took us two solid hours to cool
Horace down below the boilinâ point; and then he started off alone
with his lips set and his eyebrows pulled down to the bridge of his
nose. I liked him better ân ever. He was as game as they made âem, and
had even forgot the check âat olâ Tank Williams was still holdinâ; but
I was honestly worried about Eugene.

Part of it may have been due to havinâ his head beat mellow on a
stone; but still he allus did lack sand when he was losinâ, and now he
sat tugginâ at his real hair anâ swearinâ he was ruined, and would
take his own life the first chance he had. It was partly my fault; so
I made Tank help me tote back Eugeneâs needinâs from the deserted
cabin to his shop, Eugene goinâ along in a stupor and repeatinâ to us
constant that he intended to drink his own heartâs blood.

I sent Tank back to the Dot to see what he could do toward pacifyinâ
Horace, and then I returned the squaw dress to Ike Spargle. He broke
into a side-split when I stepped into his place, and fairly deluged me
with liquor; but I wasnât in no mood for it. Ike told me âat Spider
had gone out to the Dot to notify that he had quit temporary; and then
he was goinâ out to hunt down Red Erickson for the bounty. Ike was
equally willinâ to talk about bears or Red Erickson; but I wasnât
conversational, so I went back to Eugeneâs.

He had his door locked, and at first refused me admittance; but
finally he let me in, and I told him I would let him have his outfit
on time. He wouldnât scarcely listen to me; so the best I could do was
to get his promise that he wouldnât slay himself inside the house, as
the boys were superstitious againâ it, and would burn it down. As it
was againâ my credit at olâ man Dortâs, I felt more agreeable toward
payinâ for a standinâ house, than for just the ashes of one.

âWhen Iâm gone, Happy,â sez Eugene, âI want you to send my watch back
to Sommersville, Connecticut. Thatâs all I ask of ya. Youâve been as
near a friend to me as any one in this ungodly community has, and I
donât bear ya no ill will. If I could just have paid off that
mortgageââ

I shook hands with him and went outside, where I settled myself
comfortable and made ready to keep watch on him until he started to
drink. I felt sure that if heâd once get to elevatinâ a bottle, it
would take his mind off suicide; but he paced up and down inside his
room until I was purtâ nigh out oâ my own head.

It must have been nine in the eveninâ when he stole out his side door
with a forty-five under his coat; and started up the ravine which
opens west oâ town, and I follered like a coyote.

He went up it about a mile, anâ then he stopped anâ I flattened out
anâ crept closer anâ closer. I knew he would make a few remarks first,
even though he was alone, anâ I judged I could wriggle up close enough
to grab him in the act.

He fished out his gun, anâ I see that he didnât savvy the use of it,
which put a little uncertainty into my end oâ the game.

âFarewell, cruel world,â he muttered mournfully, usinâ his gun to
gesture with. âFarewell, sweet dreams of childhood; farewell ambition
anâ love anâ dear tyranic duty; farewell moon anâ stars anâ gentle
breezes, farewellââ

Eugene would probably have gone on sayinâ farewell to each particular
thing in the world until he talked himself to sleep, but just then a
pebble slipped from the side oâ the ravine and rolled to his feet, and
he stopped with a jerk anâ listened. Then he straightened himself anâ
sez in a determined tone: âNobody canât prevent me. I shall end it
now.â

Before I could move, he placed the muzzle to his forehead anâ fired,
rollinâ over on his back. I heard a sort of cough, like when a man
hits his best with an ax, anâ somethinâ came plumpinâ down the ravine
like an avalanche.

I rushed up, lit a match, anâ there on his back was Eugene, a small
red welt on his forehead, but looking calm and satisfied, while almost
on top of him lay a man in a heap. I straightened him out, lit another
match, anâ looked at the stranger. His hair was flaminâ red anâ you
could have tied his red mustaches around the back of his neck. He was
shot through the forehead anâ plumb dead.

I saw how it was in a flash: Eugene had almost missed himself, but had
shot Red Erickson, who had been hidinâ up the side of the ravine
behind him. I slipped Redâs empty gun into his hand, emptied Eugeneâs
gun; anâ then I tore for town, gathered up the boys anâ told âem that
Eugene had gone up the ravine bent on mischief. We got a lantern and
hurried up the ravine where Eugene was just cominâ back to genuwine
consciousness again.

He sat there with his head in his hands tryinâ to cheer himself with
some oâ the mournfullest moaninâ ever I heard. I held the lantern to
Redâs face a moment anâ bawled out: âBoys, this is Red Erickson! Him
anâ Eugene has been duelinâ, anâ they have killed each other.â

This gave Eugene his cueâanâ a cue was all Eugene ever needed. He
pulled himself together, took plenty oâ time to get the lay oâ the
land; anâ then he gave us a tale oâ that fight which laid over
anything I ever heard in that line.

We carried âem back to town, anâ Eugene was a hero for true. He got
the reward all right, paid off his debts, anâ kept addinâ details to
that fight until it was enough to keep a feller awake nights. His
reputation picked up right along until even olâ man Dort had to admit
theâ was more to Eugene than he had allowed.

Next day when I got back to the Diamond Dot, I found Horace all packed
up for leavinâ; and it made me feel mournful to the bones oâ my soul.
I didnât know how much I thought of him until he started to pull out;
and I felt so ashamed at what I had done, that I offered to let him
kick me all about the place if heâd just forget about it and stick
along.

But Horace had a stiff neck, all right, and he wouldnât give in. Tank
had had all he could do to get Horace to take the check back; and now,
try as I would, I couldnât get him to stay. I drove over to the
station with him, and we had a long talk together. He was in a good
humor when he left, and I could see he was wishful to stay; but havinâ
made up his mind, he stuck to it. He said he had had more fun while
with us than durinâ all the procedure of his life; and that if we had
just kept the joke among us Dotters, he wouldnât have felt so cut up
about it. I told him he had acted just right and that I had acted dead
wrong, although it was him takinâ Tankâs word above mine which had
first made me sore.

This was new light to him, and he softened up immediate. Fact was, we
got purtâ nigh girlish before the train pulled out with him wavinâ his
handkerchief from the back porch.

I still feel some shame about this episode; and if any oâ you fellers
ask any more questions to lead me into tellinâ of my own silly pranks,
why, Iâll drive you off the place, and then get my lips sewed shut.




CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

KIT MURRAY


Horace had left, I felt purty lonely for a while. Itâs hard for me to
look back and keep things in regular order; because the different
lines cross each other and get mixed up. Always, little Barbieâs
affairs came first with me; but I reckon most of you have heard her
story, so Iâm keepinâ shy of it this time. First of all there was my
innermost life, which would have been mostly mine no matter where Iâd
gone; then there was the part of my life which touched Barbieâs, and
this was the best and the highest part of it; and then there was the
part which touched Friar Tuck anâ a lot of others, each one of which
helped to make me what I am; but back of it all was my work; so itâs
not strange if I find it hard to stick to the trail of a story.

Anyway, it was while I was feelinâ lonesome about Horace leavinâ that
the Friar first began to use me as a trump card, and called on me for
whatever he happened to want done. I was mighty fond oâ beinâ with the
Friar; so I lent myself to him whenever I could, and we got mighty
well acquainted. He loved fun of a quiet kind; but theâ was allus a
sadness in his eyes which toned down my natural devilment and softened
me. Theâ was lots oâ things I used to enjoy doinâ, which I just
couldnât do after havinâ been with the Friar a spell, until I had give
myself a good shakinâ, like a dog cominâ up out oâ water.

For several quiet years about this time, I used to act as scout for
him, now and again, goinâ ahead to round up a bunch when he had time
to give âem a preachinâ; or goinâ after him when some one who couldnât
afford a doctor was took sick. We talked about purtâ nigh everything,
except that some way, we didnât talk much about women; so I was never
able to pump his own story out of him, though he knew exactly how I
felt toward Barbie, long before I did myself.

Durinâ these years, the Friar tried his best to get on terms with the
Ty Jones crowd; but they refused to get friendly, and the more he did
to make things better in the territory, the more they hated him.

It was right after the spring round-up that I first heard the Friarâs
name mixed up with a woman. This allus makes me madder ân about
anything else. When a man and a woman sin, why, itâs bad enough, and
Iâm not upholdinâ it; but still in a way itâs natural, the same as a
wolf killinâ a calf. Itâs the cow-puncherâs business to kill the wolf
if he can, and he ought to do it as prompt as possible. This is all
right; but gossip and scandal is never all right.

Gossip and scandal is like supposinâ the wolf had only wounded the
calf a little, and a posse would gather and tie the two of âem
together, the wolf and the wounded calf; and take âem into the center
square of a town and keep âem tied there for all to see until they had
starved to death; and then to keep on stirrinâ up the carrion day
after day as long as a shred of it remained.

The Friar was allus a great one to be talkinâ about the power of
habits. He said that if folks would just get into the habit of lookinâ
for sunshiny days, anâ smilinâ faces anâ noble deeds, and such like,
that first thing they knew theyâd think the whole world had changed
for the better; but instead oâ this they got into the habit of lookinâ
for evil, and as that was what they were on the watch for, oâ course
they found it. He said it was like a cat watchinâ for a mouse. The cat
would plant herself in front of the mouse hole and not do anything
else but just watch for the mouse. While she would be on guard, a king
might be assassinated, a city might fall in an earthquake, and a
ship-load oâ people go down at sea; but if the mouse came out and the
cat got it, she would amuse herself with it a while, eat it and then
curl up before the fire and purr about what a fine day it had been,
all because she had got what she had been lookinâ for; and theâs a lot
in this.

Now, when I came to think it over, I hadnât heard the Friar express
himself very free on women. I had heard him say to allus treat âem
kind anâ square, the good ones and the bad; but when ya come to ponder
over this, it wasnât no-wise definite. Still I couldnât believe ill of
him; so I took a vacation anâ started to hunt him up.

The feller who had told me didnât know much about it, but the feller
who had told him knew it all. When I found this feller, he was in the
same fix; and he sent me along to the one who had told him. They were
all a lot alike in not knowinâ it all; but I finally found out who the
girl was.

She was a girl named Kit Murray, and she allus had been a lively young
thing with a purty face, anâ could ride anâ shoot like a man. She had
took part in a couple oâ frontier-day exhibitions, and it had turned
her head, and she had gone out with a show. When she had come back,
she had put on more airs ân ever, and naturally the boys were some
wild about herâthough I hadnât seen her myself.

News oâ this kind travels fast, and I heard buzzinâ about it
everywhere; but it was just like all other scandal. Most people, when
they gossip, believe anâ tell the story which comes closest to what
theyâd âaâ done if theyâd had the same chance; and what I figured out
to be true was, that Olaf the Swede and another Cross-brander by the
name oâ Bud Fisher had scrapped about the girl, Olaf near killinâ the
kid and the girl runninâ off to the Friar. Now, all the good deeds âat
the Friar had done hadnât caused much talk; but this news spread like
wild-fire; and a lot oâ those he had helped the most turned againâ him
and said they wished they could find out where he was hidinâ.

I took it just the other way; I knew the Friar purty well, and what I
feared most was, that he wasnât hidinâ at all, and that Olaf would
find him before I could give him warninâ. It was two weeks before I
found the Friar; but once I came upon Olaf, face to face, and we eyed
each other purty close. This was the first time I ever noticed his
eyes. They were the queerest eyes I ever saw, a sort of blue; but a
deeper blue, a bluer blue ân anything I had ever seen outside a
flower. Theâs a flower on the benches in June just the color of his
eyes, a soft, velvety flower; but Olafâs eyes werenât soft and velvety
the day we met, and they gave me a queer, creepy feelinâ. I hope I
didnât show it any; but I did feel relieved after Iâd passed him.

Finally I found the Friar, just as I might have expectedâby the sound
of his voice. I had got clear over into the Basin and was crossinâ
through Carter Pass when I heard his voice above me, singinâ one of
his marchinâ songs. I was mightily rejoiced to find him; but I had
that all out of my face by the time I had wound around up to him. He
was totinâ a log on his shoulder, and struttinâ along as jaunty as
though the whole earth was simply his backyard.

âHere,â I growls to him, indignant, âwhat do you mean by makinâ such a
noise? Havenât you got a grain oâ gumption!â

He looked up at me with the surprise stickinâ out from under his grin.
âWell, well, well!â sez he. âWho are youâthe special officer for the
prevention of noise?â

âI ainât no special officer of anything,â I answers; âbut theâs people
lookinâ for you, and you ought to have sense enough to keep quiet.â

âAnd Iâm lookinâ for people,â sez he, grinninâ like a boy; âand the
best way to find âem is by makinâ a noise. Theâ ainât any rules againâ
walkinâ on the grass up here, is there?â

âOlaf the Swede is after you on account oâ the gal,â I blunted; âand
he ainât no bluffer. He intends to do away with you for good and all;
and youâd better be makinâ your plans.â

âGoinâ to do away with me for good anâ all,â he repeats, smilinâ.
âWell, Olaf the Swede is a gross materialist. The worst he can do will
be to tear off my wrapper and leave me free to find out a lot of
things Iâm deeply interested in. Why, Happy, youâre all worked up!
Youâve lost your philosophy, youâve become a frettish old woman. What
you need is a right good scare to straighten you up again. This Olaf
the Swede is part of Ty Jonesâs outfit, isnât he?â

âHe is,â I replied, shakinâ my head in warninâ, âand the whole gangâll
back him up in this.â

âGood!â sez the Friar, smackinâ his hand. âIâve wanted an openinâ
wedge into that outfit ever since I came out here. Of a truth, the
Lord doth move in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform.â

âWell, he certainly will have to perform some mysterious wonders to
get you out of this scrape,â I said. I was put out at the way he took
it.

âDonât be irreverent, Happy,â sez he, the joy-lights dancinâ in his
eyes. âWe are all merely instruments, and why should an instrument
take it upon itself to question the way it is used. Where is this
Olaf?â

âI met him yesterday; and for all I know, heâs been followinâ me.â

âFine, fine!â sez the Friar. âNow, you go on back to the Diamond Dot,
and Iâll go back over your trail and save Olaf as much bother as
possible.â

âIâm goinâ along with you,â I sez.

âNo,â sez he.

âYes,â sez I.

âItâll make folks think âat Iâm afraid for my skin, and have you along
for protection,â sez he, gettinâ earnest.

âIf you had good judgment, you would be afraid for your skin,â sez I.
âI tell you that Olaf is after your blood. Heâs one oâ the worst; he
kills with his bare hands when he gets the chance.â

âFine, fine!â sez the Friar again, his eyes glowinâ joyous. âIâd have
a right to defend myself with my hands, Happy. I would have a right to
do this, for the sake of Olaf, you seeâto prevent him from risking
his own soul by committinâ murder. This is a great chance for me,
Happy; now, please, please, go on back like a good fellow.â

I was secretly tickled at the argument the Friar had put up for a
chance at physical warfareâand a barehand fight between him and Olaf
would have been worth goinâ a long way to seeâbut I was as obstinate
as either of âem; so I just said âat I was goinâ along.

âWell, youâre not goinâ with, me,â sez the Friar, as pouty as a
schoolboy. âIâll not speak to ya, and Iâll not have a thing to do with
yaâ; and he threw down his log and glared at me.

I took a certain amount oâ pride because the Friar lived up to his own
standards; but I also found a certain deep-rooted amusement in havinâ
him slip out from under âem for a spell and display a human
disposition which was purty much kindred to my own. âWhat do you
purpose doinâ with that club, Friar?â I asked, pointinâ to the log he
had flung down.

He pulled in his glare and looked to be a little discomposed. âWhy
IâIâm livinâ in a cave I got back there.â

âAre you dead set againâ havinâ a little company?â sez I, slow anâ
insinuatinâ, âor are ya livinâ alone?â

First off, he was inclined to be resentful, then he grinned,
shouldered his log again, and said: âCome and see.â

I follered him back into the hills until we came to a little park in
which his ponies were grazinâ, and then I hobbled mine, cached my gear
alongside his, and trailed after him again. His path turned a crag and
then skirted along the edge of a cliff as straight up and down as the
real truth. The path kept gettinâ narrower, until every time the Friar
turned a corner ahead of me, I expected to see him walkinâ off in the
air with the log still on his shoulder.

Presently I turned a corner around which he had disappeared, and there
wasnât a soul in sight. The ledge still led along the cliff; but it
had got thinner than a lawyerâs excuse, and a worm couldnât have
walked along it without hanginâ on. While I stood there puzzlinâ about
it, a hand reached out oâ the side of the cliff, and the Friarâs voice
said mockingly: âTake my hand, little one; and then shut your eyes for
fear you might get dizzy.â

Then I saw a jag of rock stickinâ out just above my head, I grabbed it
with my left hand, and swung around into what was the mouth of a cave.
It was nothinâ but a crack about eighteen inches wide, and the far
side was sunk in enough to keep it hid from where I was standinâ. The
Friar was standinâ a few feet back in the entrance with his log
leaninâ up againâ the side. âI know not what other animals may have
sought shelter here,â he said, âbut for the past three years this has
been my castle, and, Happy Hawkins,ââhere the Friar bowed
lowââobstinate and unreasonable as you are, I offer you a hearty
welcome.â

The Friar said this in fun, but theâ was an undertone to it which
tightened the laces around my heart considâable. Well, that cave was a
sure enough surprise; he had three or four pelts and a couple of Injun
blankets on the floor, he had a couple oâ barrels fixed to catch snow
water, he had some cookinâ tools; and books! Say, he must have had as
many as a hundred books, all of âem hard-shells, and lookinâ so
edicated anâ officious that I had to take off my hat before I had
nerve enough to begin readinâ the titles.

After Iâd taken everything in, I sat down in an easy chair heâd made
out oâ saplinâs and rawhide, and looked all about; but I couldnât see
any signs of their beinâ any other rooms to this cave; and then I
jumped square for the mark, and sez: âFriar, theâs a lot oâ talk about
you havinâ run off with Kit Murray. Now I want the straight of it.â

His face went grave and a little hurt. âItâs strange,â he said after a
time, âhow hard it is for a man to believe in his own guilt, and how
easy for him to believe in the guilt of his neighbor. Have you had any
dinner?â

âYes,â sez I. âI didnât know just where I was headinâ; so I et three
different times this morninâ to make sure of havinâ enough to run on
in case of emergency.â

âItâs a fine thing to be an outdoor animal,â sez the Friar, smilinâ.
âWell then, Iâve made up my mind to take you to see Kit Murray.â

He didnât waste any time askinâ me not to talk about what was other
folksâ affairs; he just went to the door, grabbed the jag of rock,
swung around to the ledge, and I follered after.

We saddled up, rode down a windinâ path âat Iâd never heard of before,
and then rode up again until we came to a little clump oâ swamp
shrubbery, backed up againâ the north face oâ Mount Mizner. We
follered a twisty path through this and finally came out on an open
space in which stood a fair-sized cabin. He whistled a five-note call,
and the door was opened by an old woman who was a stranger to me.
âMother Shipley, this is Happy Hawkins,â sez he. âHowâs Kit?â

The old woman gave me a gimlet look, and then her sharp features
expanded to a smile, and she bobbed her head. âKitâs gettinâ hard to
manage,â sez she.

We went into the cabin, and found Kit with a bandage around her ankle,
sittinâ in a rockinâ chair, and lookinâ patiently disgusted. She was a
fine-lookinâ girl, with a fair streak of boy in her, and she had never
had enough practice at beinâ an invalid to shine at it. Her face lit
up at the Friar; but her gaze was mighty inquirinâ when she turned it
at me.

âYou know Happy Hawkins, donât ya?â sez the Friar. She nodded her
head, and he went on. âWell, heâs one oâ the fellers you can trust, if
you trust him entire; but heâs got such a bump of curiosity that if
you donât tell it all to him in the first place, he canât do no other
work until he finds it out on his own hook. Heâs my friend, and heâll
be your friend; so I want you to tell him just how things are, and
then heâll be under obligations to do whatever we want him to.â

So Kit cut loose and told me her story. Her father, olâ Jim Murray,
had got crippled up about ten years before, and since then had become
a professional homesteader, nosinâ out good places, anâ then sellinâ
out to the big cattle outfits. He also made it his business to find
ways to drive off genuwine homesteaders; and in addition to this he
was a home tyrant and hard to live with. He allus had plenty oâ money,
but was generally dead broke when it came to pleasant words anâ
smilesâwhich was why Kit had gone off with the show.

While she was away, she had married a low-grade cuss, who had misused
her beyond endurance; so when he had skipped with another woman, she
had come back to the old man. She didnât want folks âat knew her to
find out how bad hit sheâd been; so she had tried to bluff it out; but
the young fellers kept fallinâ in love with her and wantinâ to marry
her. She hadnât meant no harm; but she had played one againâ the
other, hopinâ theyâd soon have their feelinâs hurt and let her alone.
This was a fool notion, but she had been honest in it.

Bud Fisher, the Texas kid in the Ty Jones outfit, had got daffy about
her; and then one night at a dance she had shot some smiles into the
eyes of Olaf the Swede. She said he was such a glum-lookinâ cuss she
had no idee he would take it serious; but he had stood lookinâ into
her eyes with his queer blue ones, until she had felt sort oâ fainty;
and from that on, he had declared war on all who glanced at her.

Bud Fisher thought it a fine joke for Olaf to fall in love, and he had
teased him to the limit. This made a bad condition, and all through
the spring round-up, each had done as much dirt as possible to the
other; but Ty was mighty strict about his men fightinâ each other; so
they hadnât come to a clash.

Finally the kid brags that he is goinâ to elope with Kit; and then
Olaf kicks off his hobbles anâ starts to stampede. The kid was wise
enough to vamoose; so Olaf rides down to olâ man Murrayâs, and reads
the riot act to him. Kit was hidinâ in the back room and heard it all.
He told the old man that he would slaughter any one who eloped with
Kit or who had a hand in it; and then he had gone back to hunt the kid
again.

The olâ man turned in and gave Kit a complete harrowinâ as soon as
Olaf had left and she had told him pointedly that sheâd eat dirt
before sheâd eat his food again; so she saddled her pony and started
to ride without knowinâ where. Her pony had slipped on Carter Pass and
she had sprained her ankle so bad she couldnât stand. Just at this
junction, the Friar had come along, and had put her up on his horse
and held her on with one arm about her, because the pain in her ankle
made her head light. On the way they came smack up againâ the kid, and
he gave âem a grin, and went out without askinâ questions.

He went straight to Olaf, and told him that Kit had eloped with the
Friar. The Friar had brought her up to Shipleyâs, they havinâ been
friends of his in Colorado. They had a daughter livinâ up in Billings,
Montana; and as soon as her ankle could stand it, Kit was goinâ up to
live with the daughter, she havinâ three little children and a
railroad husband who was away from home more ân half the time.

This was the whole oâ the story; but you can easy see what a fine
prospect it made for gossip, and also what a fine time a young imp
like Bud Fisher could have with a sober feller like Olaf. Olaf
wouldnât have just grounds for makinâ away with Bud for doinâ nothinâ
except grin, so long as the Friar remained alive with the girl in his
keepinâ. It was a neat little mess; and from what we found out
afterwards, the kid was as irritatinâ as a half-swallered cockle-burr.

Big, silent fellers like Olaf are just like big, new boilers. A little
leaky boiler fizzes away all the time, but when it comes to explode,
it hasnât anything on hand to explode with; while a big, tight boiler,
when it does go off, generally musses up the landscape considâable;
and when Olaf started to stampede he made more noise in a week ân Bud
Fisher had in his whole life.

When Kit had finished tellinâ me the story, I shook hands with her,
and said that while she hadnât used the best judgment theâ was, she
had probably used the best she had; and that it was more the menâs
fault than hers, so she could count on me as far as I could travel.
Then I went outside while the Friar and olâ Mother Shipley fixed up
her ankle.

They all seemed pleased about the way it was healinâ, and after it was
tied up, Kit stood on it and even took a few steps. It twisted her
face a time or two at first; but after sheâd gone across the room and
back a few times, she said it felt better ân it had for years. This
made us all laugh, âcause fact was, she hadnât been housed in near up
to the average of a sprained ankle. The Friar allowed âat sheâd be fit
to travel day after the next; so it was planned to start in the
eveninâ, and for both of us to go with her. Then we had an early
supper anâ started home.

On the way, I complained about the foolish way in which Kit had acted,
for the sole purpose of drawinâ the Friar out and gettinâ his views on
women. Nearly always when I got him started, I was able to pick up
some little sayinâ which furnished me with more thought-food than his
blocked-out sermons did.

âOf course Kit was foolish,â he admitted; âbut what show has she ever
had? Her father never was fit to bring her up; and he didnât even do
the best he could. A woman has more vital strength than a man, because
the future of the race depends on her; but she also has more emotions,
so âat the wear anâ tear is greater. Man, on the other hand, has more
muscle ân woman, and more brutality. Foolinâ man has been the best way
a woman had to fight for a good many centuries; and this was the way
poor Kit tried to fight. The plain, simple truth generally works best;
but it takes wisdom to see this, and wisdom is seldom anything more
than the dregs oâ folly. Theâ was no one to teach Kit wisdom; so she
has had to strain off her own folly; but she is a fine, brave girl,
and I think she will profit by experience.â

Now this was a new thought to me, about wisdom beinâ nothinâ but the
dregs oâ folly; but itâs a good tough thought, and Iâve had a heap oâ
chewinâ on it since then; so I feel repaid in havinâ took sides againâ
Kit and lurinâ the Friar into heavinâ it at me.

It was dark when we reached his twistinâ path along the ledge, and I
stepped as cautious as a glow-worm in a powder-mill; but as soon as we
had our pipes anâ the fire goinâ, I wouldnât have swapped seats with
the fattest king in the universe.




CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

TESTING THE FRIARâS NERVE


As soon as we had eaten breakfast next morninâ, the Friar sez: âYou,
beinâ one oâ the earth animals, have never had much chance to see a
view. Yesterday your curiosity was itchinâ so âat I doubt if you could
have told a mountain peak from a Mexican hat; but now that you have
temporarily suppressed your thirst for gossip, had a good sleep, and a
better breakfast, drag yourself out to the front porch and take a
birdâs-eye view of the world.â

Well, it was worth it, it certainly was worth it! What he called the
front porch, was the ledge after it had flipped itself around the
jutting; and when a feller stood on it, he felt plenty enough like a
bird to make it interestinâ. The Big Horns ran across the top oâ the
picture about a hundred anâ forty miles to the north, and gettinâ all
blended in with the clouds. On the other two sides were different
members of the Shoshone family, most oâ which I knew by sight from any
angle; and down below was miles anâ miles of country spread out like a
map, but more highly colored.

âFriar,â I sez, âyouâre a wealthy man.â

This tickled him a lot, âcause he was as proud oâ that view as if heâd
painted it. âI am, Happy,â he said, âand I have yielded to a wealthy
manâs temptations. Any one who comes here will be welcome; but I own
up, I have kept this place a secret to have it all to myself.â

âA man like you needs some quiet place to consider in,â sez I.

âGet thee behind me, Satan, get thee behind me,â cried the Friar. âI
have been on far too friendly terms with that excuse for many a long
month. But I do enjoy this place; so I am going to let you help me lay
in my winterâs supply of wood, and then make you a joint member in
full standing.â

We packed wood along that spider thread of a path all morning; and
finally I got so it didnât phaze me any more ân it did him. He sang at
his work most of the time, and I joined in with him whenever I felt so
moved, though it did strike me âat this was a funny way to keep a
place secret; and my idee is that he sang to ease his conscience by
showinâ it that he wasnât sneakinâ about his treasure.

I remember him mighty plain as he walked before me on the ledge,
totinâ a big log on his shoulder, and singinâ the one âat begins,
âHark, my soul! It is the Lord!â This was one he fair used to raise
himself in, and it seemed as if we two were climbinâ right up on the
air, plumb into the sky. When heâd let himself out this way, heâd fill
me so full of a holy kind of devilment, that it would âaâ given me joy
to have leaped off the cliff with him, and take chances on goinâ up or
down.

We had about filled his wood place, and were goinâ back after the last
load when just as he swung around a corner, I saw his hand go up as
though warninâ me to stop; and I froze in my tracks. He hadnât been
singinâ this trip, for a wonder; but the next moment I heard a sound
which purt nigh jarred me off. It was a low, deep growl which I
instantly recognized as belonginâ to Olaf the Swede. Olaf didnât talk
with much brogue, though when he got excited he had his own fashion
for hitchinâ words together.

âWhere is the girl?â he asked with quiet fierceness, and for a space I
was sorry my parents hadnât been eagles. There wasnât room to fight
out on that ledge, the Friar didnât have a gun on, I couldnât possibly
shoot around him; and Olaf was seven parts demon when he laid back his
ears and started to kick.

âWhere she cannot be bothered,â sez the Friar, full as quiet but
without any fierceness. Theâ was a little bush about eight feet up,
and I felt sure it would hide me, so I stuck my fingers in the side oâ
the cliff and climbed up; but theâ was no way for me to get out to the
bush, and I had to drop back to the ledge and stand there with the
sweat tricklinâ down between my shoulders until I felt like yellinâ.

âI intend to kill you,â said Olaf, as calm as though talkinâ about a
sick sheep.

âIt would be a foolish waste of time,â replied the Friar, as if he was
advisinâ a ten-year-old boy not to fish when the Blue Bull was high
and muddy. âIt wouldnât do any good, and I shall not allow it.â

[Illustration: âI intend to kill you,â said Olaf, as calm as though
talkinâ about a sick sheep.

âIt would be a foolish waste of time,â replied the Friar, as if he was
advisinâ a ten-year-old boy not to fish when the Blue Bull was high
and muddy. âIt wouldnât do any good, and I shall not allow it.â]

I got out my gun, and made ready to do whatever the angels suggested;
but for some time theâ was silence, and durinâ this time I was keyed
up so tight my muscles began to ache. I knew they were lookinâ into
each otherâs eyes, and Iâd have given a finger off each hand to see
how the Friarâs steady gray eyes handled those queer blue ones of
Olaf.

âIs she all right?â asked Olaf, and all the threat had left his voice,
and it had just a glint oâ pleadinâ in it. I wouldnât have been one
bit more surprised to have seen a prairie-dog come flyinâ up the
gorge, blowinâ a cornet with his nose.

âShe has sprained her ankle; but aside from this has no physical ill,â
sez the Friar. âYou men have caused her a lot of worry, and her soul
is sick; but her body is well.â

After another silence, Olaf said slowly: âYes, yes; I can tell by the
light that you speak true. What do you intend to do with her?â

âI intend to cure her,â sez the Friar. âI intend to help and
strengthen her; and I want you to help her, too. Olaf, she has had a
lot of trouble, and her wild gaiety is only a veil to hide the wounds
in her heart. I want you to help her.â

âI know, I know she is honest,â said Olaf, and blamed if his voice
didnât sound like a new boy talkinâ to the boss; âbut she made me love
her. Yes, I do love her. I must marry her. Yes, this is so.â

âShe cannot marry you, or any one else, now,â sez the Friar, kindly.
âThis is why she has gone from one man to anotherâto disgust them all
and make them leave her alone.â

âThat is a damn devil of a way,â cried Olaf in anger. âWhy should she
go to dances, and out ridinâ, and so on, if she wants men to leave her
alone?â

âShe was foolish, she knows that now; but her father is not the right
sort of a man, and her home was not pleasant,â said the Friar.

âI told him I kill him, if she marry any one but me,â said Olaf. âI
know he is not honest; but he is afraid of me, and he will not bother
her now. I go to see him again purty soon, and tell him some more.
Wonât you tell me where she is?â

âI want to be your friend, Olaf,â said the Friar gently. âI tell you
honest that she cannot marry now. When I see her again, I shall tell
her of meetinâ you, and what you have said. I have no desire except to
do the best for all of you, and if you love her truly, all you will
want will be to do that which is best for her.â

The Friar paused, and I pulled my ear clear to the edge oâ the rock,
so as not to miss a word. âOlaf,â he went on in a low, sorrowful
voice, âthe love of a man for a woman is a wonderful thing, a terrible
thing, a soul-testing thing. Donât let your love become common for men
to talk over. In believing what men have told you of me you have
insulted her, by admitting that such a thing is possible. Go back to
your work, kill no man for what he says of her; but keep her pure in
your own heart, and this will be the best way to keep her pure before
the world. Silence the gossips by living above them; and if it becomes
necessary for you to take your own love by the throat, then do it, and
do it for love of her. I shall do all I can to make her worthy of
you.â

You should have heard the Friarâs voice when he was sayinâ this. I
stood on the little ledge, just breathinâ enough to keep my lungs
ventilated, and lookinâ out across the landscapeâmountains on all
sides of me, and down below the broken ground and the benches, with
the green strips along the cricks lookinâ like lazy snakes in the hot
sunshine. I couldnât see a livinâ creature, I felt like the last man
on earth; and that deep, musical voice seemed cominâ to me from
somewhere out beyond the limits of life. I didnât have any more fear
now: theâ wasnât anything in the shape of a human who could have done
violence to the Friar after hearinâ him say the words Iâd just heard;
so I put up my gun, and listened again.

âCanât ya tell me why she canât marry me?â asked Olaf, and theâ was a
tremble in his voice, almost as though it flowed up from a sob.

âI think I can trust you to keep her secret,â sez the Friar. âShe is
married already. The man was a beast and deserted her; but he is still
alive, and she cannot marry again.â

I heard Olaf make a queer, animal sound with his breath, and then he
said: âYes, you speak trueâI can tell by the light; but she loves
meâI can tell that also by the light. Will you tell me when she can
marry?â

âI will,â sez the Friar, and his voice was a pledge. âThereâs my hand
on it.â

They brought their hands together with a smack I could hear, and then
Olaf turned on the narrow ledge, with the Friar holdinâ him on, anâ
started off. The Friar went along with him, and I sneaked after,
keepinâ a turn between us. Olaf mounted his hoss and rode away without
lookinâ back, which, as a matter oâ fact, was his way oâ doinâ things;
and when he was out oâ sight, I joined the Friar.

Theâ was still a look of sadness in the Friarâs face; but back of it,
and shininâ through it, was a quiet satisfaction. He was full oâ the
scene he had just gone through; and presently he turned anâ said:
âThat was a glorious victory he gained over himself, Happy. That man
has a good heart, and who knows but what he will yet be the means of
bringinâ me anâ Tyrrel Jones together.â

âWhat do you reckon he meant by the light tellinâ him that you were an
honest man?â I asked. This was the most curious part of the whole
thing to me.

âHow can I tell,â he sez. âLife is so crowded with wonders that I have
quit wonderinâ about âem; but I always feel a thrill when I see the
stubborn spirit of a strong man melt and run into the mold the Master
has prepared for it.â

âIâll own it was about the weirdest thing I ever saw,â sez I; âbut Iâm
willinâ to bet that whatever else Olafâs spirit has molded itself
into, itâs not a doormat with âwelcomeâ wrote on it; as the first
feller âat fools with that girl is likely to find out.â

âNever doubt the power of the Lord, Happy,â sez he. âThe hand that
piled up these hills can easy shape even so stubborn a thing as the
human will.â

âYes,â I agreed; âbut it generally takes just about the same length of
time to do it, and a man donât usually last that long.â

âTime!â sez he; âwhat do you know about time? It may have taken ages
to form these hills; and then again, it may have been done in the
twinklinâ of an eye. From the way the streaks tilt up, Iâm inclined to
think it was done sudden.â

I looked at the lines along the faces oâ the hills, and I was inclined
to believe it, too; so I dropped that subject, and we sat down close
together and looked off down the trail where Olaf had vanished.

We sat in silence a long time, me thinkinâ oâ what sort of a light
Olaf had seen to make him know âat the Friar was honest; and of the
way the Friarâs voice had gone through me when he had talked of love.

This was a new idee to me, and one oâ the biggest I had ever tried to
grapple with. Before this, my notion oâ love was, for a man to get the
girl any way he could; and it took me some time to see the grandness
of a man takinâ his own love by the throat for love of a woman. I knew
âat the Friar had done this himself; but it never was clear to me
until I heard the heartache moaninâ through his voice as he laid out
this law for Olaf, and Olaf bowed his stiff neck and accepted it.

Iâm purty sure that if Iâd âaâ known that day, that a few years later
I would have to take my own love by the throat for the sake of little
Barbie, I wouldnât âaâ had the nerve to go on playinâ the gameâbut
this is life. We pick up a stone here, and another there, and build
them into our wall until the flood comes; and then if the wall isnât
high enough to turn back the flood, all the sting and bitterness comes
from knowinâ that we havenât made use of all the stones which came
rollinâ down to our feet.

That night we had an uncommon fine fire in the cave. I used to enjoy
these eveninâ fires with the Friar, as much as a dog likes to have his
ears pulled by the hand he loves best. He would tell me tales of all
the ages âat man has lived on the face of the whole earth, and Iâd sit
and smoke my pipe, and make up what Iâd âaâ done, myself, if Iâd been
one oâ these big fellers. These chummy little fire-talks used to
broaden me out and make me feel related to the whole human race, and
it was then âat I came to know the Friar bestâthough theâ ainât no
way to put this into a story.

Along about nine oâclock the Friar began to lecture me againâ the use
oâ violence, pointinâ out that war nor gunfightinâ nor any other sort
oâ violence had ever done any good; and endinâ up with the way he had
handled Olaf as illustratinâ how much better effects spiritual methods
had.

âHumph,â sez I, âso youâre tryinâ to put that over as an ordinary
case, are ya? Did you ever before see such eyes in a manâs head as
what Olaf has?â

âNow that you mention it,â sez he, âI did notice they were peculiar.â

âI ruhly believe youâre right,â sez I, sarcastic. âWhen he said he saw
light he wasnât speakinâ in parables. He can see things âat you nor I
canât seeâthough I doubt if he understands âem himself.â

âStill, violence would have spoiled everything,â persisted the Friar,
who was as human as a raw bronco when you tried to make him back up.

âNow, donât forget anything,â sez I. âIt wasnât my face âat lit up
when I said âat he did his killinâ with bare hands; nor it wasnât me
who gloated over this as furnishinâ an excuse to use my bare hands in
defendinâ myself.â

âOh, Happy, Happy,â sez he, with one oâ the bursts âat made ya willinâ
to go through fire and water for him. âIâm the entire human race:
there isnât a single sin or weakness which hasnât betrayed me at one
time or another, and yet the wicked pride of me persists in stickinâ
up its head anâ crowinâ every time I take my eyes off it.â

âWell, I like your pride full as well as any other part oâ ya,â sez I;
âand before you wrangle it into its corral again, I want to say âat no
other man in the world could âaâ told Olaf what you told him this
morninâ, and lived to talk it over around this fire to-nightâunless,
he had used the best and the quickest brand oâ violence theâ is, in
the meantime.â

âNow, that you have succeeded in flatterinâ both of us, weâll go to
sleep,â sez the Friar, and theâ was a deep twinkle in his eyes which
allus rejoiced me to call up.

Next night soon after dark, we started out with Kit Murray. She rode
like a man and could tick out her fifty or sixty a day right along,
without worryinâ her pony. As soon as she was safe located in
Billings, I turned back to the Dot, while the Friar rounded up some
stray sheep he had near the border, and as far as I can recall we
didnât meet again all that summer.




CHAPTER NINETEEN

OTHER PEOPLEâS BUSINESS


Olafâs theories concerninâ violence didnât harmonize complete with the
Friarâs; but his method for discouraginâ scandal was thorough to a
degree. He silenced the gossipers all right, though so far as I heard,
most of âem recovered; and the outcome was âat the Friar stood higher
after the scandal ân he had before.

The Cross brand outfit was a good deal like a pack oâ dogs: they each
sought Ty Jonesâs favor, and they were all jealous of each other. Olaf
stood high on account of his mysterious insight; so Badger-face, the
foreman, backed up Bud Fisher to devil Olaf as far as possible without
givinâ Olaf what Ty would judge a fit excuse for unscrewinâ the kidâs
neck; and from the talk I heard, their outfit trotted along as smooth
anâ friendly as seven he bears hitched to a freight wagon; but our
trails didnât cross frequent, so it was all hearsay.

The winter before had been so fierce âat a lot oâ small outfits
couldnât winter through their stock. Towards spring, olâ Cast Steel
had bought in the Half Moon brand for a hundred anâ fifty dollars; and
that summer me anâ Spider Kelley put in our spare time huntinâ strays.
Spider had come back, flat broke and full oâ repentance; so after Iâd
stood him on his head in a buffalo-wallow full oâ mud, I forgave him
free and frank, and this summer we rode together most oâ the time.

Olâ Cast Steel was as lucky as a hump-back cat, and this summer the
grass was fatter ân ever Iâd seen it. We rounded up over five hundred
head oâ ponies, and over sixty cows, which was just like beinâ caught
out in a gold storm without your slicker on; so we didnât sympathize
any with the old man, but prospected around for pleasure whenever we
felt like it.

One afternoon after the fall round-up, me anâ Spider found ourselves
in a mighty rough bit oâ country on the north slope oâ the Wind River
range. We had been herdinâ six or eight Half Moon ponies before us for
several days, devilinâ a parcel of Injuns into thinkinâ âat we was out
tradinâ; but we had got weary oâ this, anâ were just foolinâ around
and wishinâ âat somethinâ would turn up to amuse us.

âAw, letâs go on back home,â sez Spider, not knowinâ he was speakinâ
wisdom. âIâd sooner work at work than work at huntinâ up somethinâ to
amuse myself with.â

âWell,â I sez, âweâll finish out this afternoon, anâ then if nothinâ
turns up, weâll go back, draw our pay anâ go into Boggs.â

We saw our ponies start around a butte ahead of us anâ stop to examine
somethinâ. We followed âem around the butte, and there below us on a
little level, was a bunch of menâseven of âem. We drew up anâ gave
âem a look-over.

âWhat do you make out?â sez I.

âOlaf the Swede with a rope around his neck, anâ Badger-face Flannigan
holdinâ the other end oâ the rope,â sez Spider. âWhat do you reckon
theyâre goinâ to do to him?â

âComb his hair, or fit a new sun-bonnet on him,â sez I, sarcastic.
âWhat else do they put a manâs neck in a noose for? Letâs go down anâ
see what happens.â

âA fellerâs not sure of a welcome at such times,â sez Spider.

âNo,â I agreed; âbut I want to see Olafâs eyes again, and this may be
my last chance.â

âIt may be your last chance to see anything,â sez Spider. âThe best
thing we can do is just to back-track. We interrupted âem once before;
and I donât want âem to get the idee that we spend all our time
dogginâ their footsteps for a chance to spoil their fun. This ainât
any of our business.â

âWe wonât spoil their fun,â sez I. âIf they get suspicious, we can
take a hand in it, anâ that will fix it all right. Olaf ainât nothinâ
to us; and I donât intend to risk my fat for him, just âcause heâs got
curious eyes.â

âNo, Iâm not goinâ,â sez Spider.

I looked across at the group again, anâ there cominâ up the trail
behind âem was Friar Tuck, ridinâ a round little pinto, anâ leadinâ a
big bay.

âWell, you just stay here, anâ be damned to you,â sez I to Spider.
âIâm goinâ on down.â So me anâ Spider rode down together, anâ arrived
at just the same time as the Friar did.

Badger-face looked first at us, anâ then at the Friar. âWhat the hell
do you fellers want this time?â he sez to us in welcome.

âWe just happened along,â sez I. âWhatâs goinâ on?â

âYouâre goinâ on yourselves, first thing,â sez Badger-face. âThatâs
whatâs goinâ on.â

âI guess âat you ainât got neither deeds nor lease to this land,â sez
I. âWe havenât any intention of interferinâ with you; but we donât
intend to be sent where we donât want to go. Weâve got business here,
huntinâ up stray hosses, anâ I reckon weâll just stick around.â

âYou got business here, too, I suppose?â sez Badger-face, turninâ to
the Friar.

âYes,â sez the Friar calmly. âI came here entirely by accident; but
now it is my business to inquire into why you have a rope about this
manâs neck. You recall havinâ put me into a similar perdicament, Mr.
Flannigan.â

âYes, anâ the only thing I regret is, that I was interrupted,â growls
Badger-face. âBut this time, theâ ainât any chance to change the
programme, so you might just as well poke on into some one elseâs
affairs.â

âWhatâs the matter, Olaf?â asked the Friar.

Before Olaf could reply, Badger-face gave a jerk on the rope. âYou
shut up,â sez he.

âSurely you will give the man a chance to speak,â cried the Friar,
indignant.

âIt wonât do him no good to speak,â sez Badger-face. âHeâs committed a
murder, but of course he denies it. Now, get out oâ here, all three of
ya.â

âListen,â sez the Friar, as steady anâ strong as the sweep of a deep
river, âI care more for justice ân I do for law. I know that hanginâ a
man has never done any good; but it is usually regarded as a legal
form of punishment, and the prejudice in its favor is still too strong
for one man to overcome. If you convince me that this man would be
hung by a court, why, I shall never say a word about it; but if you do
not convince me, I shall stir up all the trouble I can. I have quite a
number of friends, Mr. Flannigan.â

Badger-face studied over this a moment; and he saw it had sense. âAll
right,â sez he, âweâll try him fair anâ square; and then you three
will have to help string him, anâ I guess thatâll keep your mouths
shut.â

âTell your story, Olaf,â sez the Friar.

âWell,â sez Olaf, âwe came up short on the round-up, anâ the old man
raised Cain about it, anâ sent us out to hunt for strays. Badger-face
split us into pairs, anâ made me anâ Bud Fisher work together. We saw
some cows up on a ledge where we couldnât ride to; so we left the
hosses below, anâ climbed to see if they had our brand. If they had,
we intended to ride around and get âem. If not it would save half a
day. Bud Fisher had a rifle along, hopinâ to get a mountain sheep, anâ
he insisted on takinâ it with him. He climbed up on a ledge, anâ I
passed up the rifle to him. It was a long stretch, anâ I passed it
muzzle first. The hammer caught on a point of rock, anâ shot him
through the stomach. I didnât bear him any ill will any moreâI ran
down to the hosses, anâ brought up the saddle-blankets anâ the
slickers, anâ made him as comfortable as I could. Then I hunted up
Badger-face anâ told him. When we got back he was dead. This is the
truth.â

âI think it is,â sez the Friar.

âAw rot!â sez Badger-face. âCome on, now, anâ finish it. Every one
knows how they hated each other; and itâs plain enough that when the
Swede here got the chance, he just put Bud out oâ the way, anâ Bud was
one oâ the finest boys theâ ever was in the worldâalways full oâ fun
anâ frolic; while Olaf has allus been sour anâ gloomy.â

Most men are as sappy as green grain, anâ they bow whichever way the
wind blows. The Cross brand punchers all looked extremely sad when
Badger-face spoke oâ what a royal good feller Bud Fisher had been, anâ
when he stopped, they all glared at Olaf as friendly as wolves,
especially a skinny feller by the name of Dixon, who had the neck and
disposition of a snake.

âIf you thought âat Olaf anâ Fisher hated each other, why did you make
âem work together?â asked the Friar; and the Cross brand punchers
pricked up their ears anâ looked pointedly at Badger-face.

âI thought they had made it up,â sez Badger-face, surprised into
takinâ the defensive.

âI have noticed that you are likely to jump hasty at conclusions,â sez
the Friar, speakinâ with tantalizinâ slowness. He was a fisher of men,
all right, the Friar was; and just then he was fishinâ for those Cross
brand punchers. âDid Bud speak before he died, Olaf?â he asked
impartially.

Olaf hung his head: âAll he said was, that she hadnât never cared for
him, anâ that he didnât know one thing againâ her,â said Olaf.

âAw, whatâs the use oâ stringinâ it out,â sez Badger-face. âLetâs hang
him and have it over with.â

âHanging a fellow-beinâ is a serious matter, Mr. Flannigan,â sez the
Friar. âI am a party to this now, and shall have to assume my share of
the responsibility. I shall never consent to swinginâ a man on such
evidence as this. Let us go and examine the spot. The hammer may have
left a scratch, or something. If you convince me that Olaf committed
the murder, I pledge to assist in hanginâ him. Thatâs certainly fair,
men,â he sez to the Cross-branders, anâ they nodded their heads that
it was.

So we clumb up to the spot where Olaf claimed to have handed the gun;
but theâ wasnât any scratch on the rock. âDid he fall from the ledge
when he was shot?â asked the Friar.

âNo,â sez one oâ the punchers. âHe fell on the edge anâ hung on.â

âDid the bullet go clean through him?â asked the Friar.

âYes, it went clear through,â sez the feller.

âPoint with your finger just where it went in, anâ just where it came
out,â sez the Friar.

The feller pointed with one finger in front, anâ one behind. The Friar
took a rope anâ had me hold it behind the feller at just the level of
that finger anâ then he made Spider stretch the rope so that it passed
on a line with the finger in front. The whole crowd was interested by
this time. âNow, then,â sez the Friar, âwhere could Olaf have stood to
shoot such a line as that. He could not have shot while he was
climbinâ up, nor he couldnât have reached high enough while standinâ
below.â

âHe could, too,â sez Badger-face, âfor Bud would have been leaninâ
over, reachinâ for the gun.â

âIf he had been shot while he was reachinâ over, he would have fallen
from the ledge,â flashed the Friar.

âMaybe he did,â snapped Badger-face, just as quick. âOlaf here is as
strong as a horse, anâ maybe he put him back on the ledge. He had
blood on his hands anâ you can still see it on his shirt. A man donât
bleed much when shot in the belly.â

Olafâs queer blue eyes turned from one to the other, but his face
didnât change expression much. He had about give up hope in the first
place, anâ his face had the look of a hoss, after heâs been throwed
four or five times anâ just keels over on his side anâ sez to himself:
âWell, theyâve put the kibosh on me, anâ I donât intend to make a fool
of myself any more by tryinâ to break loose.â The rest of us was more
excited about it than Olaf was himself.

âWhich one of us is the nearest size to Bud Fisher?â asked the Friar.

They all agreed that Spider Kelley was; so the Friar had him coon up
on the ledge. Then he had Olaf take the empty rifle just as he had
held it when he passed it up; but made him give it to Badger-face
himself to pass up. Badger-face passed it up, Spider Kelley reached
for it, took it, and started to straighten upâThe hammer caught on
the precise knob that Olaf had said it had, anâ snapped hard enough to
set off a cartridge. âThere,â sez the Friar, sweepinâ his hands wide.
We could all see that the bullet would âaâ gone through just where it
did go.

âHand back the rifle, anâ Iâll show ya how he passed it up,â said
Badger-face. Spider passed it down, anâ we all watched intent. It had
become like a real court oâ law; we had forgot what the case was
about, we was so interested in seeinâ the scrap the lawyers were
puttinâ up.

Badger-face cocked the rifle so slick we didnât see him, called out to
Spider to catch it, anâ tossed it up to him. It came just short oâ
Spiderâs hand; and without thinkinâ oâ what he was doinâ, Spider
reached for the gun. This brought him squattinâ just the time the gun
dropped back into Badgerâs hands, and quick as a wink, he pulled the
triggerâand hanged if that bullet wouldnât have traveled through the
same hole the first one had made.

I never saw circumstantial evidence give such a work-out before. If we
had all been fair-minded, it would have puzzled us; but as it was, we
sided accordinâ to our prejudices; anâ the Cross brand fellers chose
Badger-face to Olaf, Badger-face beinâ foreman. The Friar saw he was
stumped.

âAre there any marks up there?â he asked of Spider.

âThereâs some blood streaks on a stone,â sez Spider.

âDid you notice âem?â asked the Friar of Badger-face.

âYes,â sez he; âbut they donât mean nothinâ.â

âLetâs go up anâ look at âem,â sez the Friar, so we all clumb up.

They pointed out just where Bud Fisher had laid when they found him;
and close beside him was a smooth white stone with blood marks on it.
The Friar examined the lay oâ the ledge; but it didnât tell nothinâ,
so finally he got down on his knees anâ studied the blood-stained
stone.

Presently he nodded his head and straightened up. âExamine that
stone,â he said, pointinâ with his fingers. We all crowded about anâ
studied it. Theâ was finger anâ thumb prints all over it; but if you
looked close, you could make out the rude image of a man pullinâ up a
gun which had exploded on the edge of a ledge. It was a smudgey,
shakey affair, but if ya looked just right you could make it out. Yet,
even this didnât floor Badger-face.

âThe Swede there did that himself,â he growled; âand this makes him
out sneakier ân we thought him. Letâs hang him, and get rid oâ this
foolishness.â

âFlannigan,â sez the Friar in cold, hard tones, âyou have gone too far
this time. If you had hung Olaf at first, you might have done it from
a proverted sense oâ justice; but to do it now would be murder; and
your own men wouldnât help. Do any of you men chew tobacco?â

If he had asked for a can oâ face-paint, we wouldnât âaâ been more
surprised; but to show the hold the Friar had gained over that crowd,
every feller there but Badger-face held out his plug to him.

âMake some tobacco juice, Olaf,â he said.

Olaf bit off a hunk the size of a walnut from his own piece, anâ
proceeded to make juice, as though his life depended upon the amount
of it. âWet your thumb and fingers with it, and make marks on the
white stone,â commanded the Friar.

Olaf did so; and when we saw the difference in size and shape, we
savvied the game.

âOlaf took Budâs hand and made the marks with Budâs own blood,â sez
Badger-face.

âDid any one here ever try to handle a dead manâs hand?â asked the
Friar; and that settled it. We all nodded our heads, except
Badger-face, anâ he had sense enough to see âat he had lost the deal,
so he didnât say nothinâ.

âWhat I canât see is, why he didnât write,â sez the Friar.

âHe couldnât write,â chirps up two punchers at once, anâ then they
took the rope off Olafâs neck.

They talked it over and decided that the best thing to do was to bury
Bud Fisher right there in the caÃ±on. Theâ was a little cave on the
ledge back oâ where we were standinâ so two oâ the punchers went down
where they had him laid out under the slickers, anâ brought him up. We
had to hoist him on ropes, anâ the Friar looked a long time into his
face.

It was just a ladâs face: not bad nor hardened; just the face of a
mischievous boy, weary after a dayâs sport. We all took a look, anâ
then put him in the little cave anâ heaped clods over him anâ piled
stones on until the door was blocked shut againâ varmints.

The Friar sat down on a big rockâhe had worked as hard as any of
usâand sat thinkinâ with his chin in his hand. The Cross brand
fellers muttered among themselves for a moment, anâ then one of âem
took off his hat, anâ sez, âDonât ya think yaâd ought to speak
somethinâ over him, parson?â

âDo you want me to?â asked the Friar. And they all nodded their heads.

So the Friar, he took off his battered hat and stood up before us anâ
spoke a sermon, while we took off our hats, anâ sat around on stones
to listen.

Iâm convinced âat the Friarâs long suit lay in the fact âat he allus
preached at himself. Most preachers have already divided the sheep
from the goats; and they allus herd off contented with the sheep on
green pastures, and preach down at the goats on the barren rocks; but
if the Friar made any division at all, he classed himself in with the
goats.

You see, in agreeinâ to help string Olaf should he be convicted, the
Friar had bet his soul on the outcome; and this braced him up in that
crowd as nothinâ else would; for they knew that if he had lost, heâd
have pulled harder on the rope ân any one else.

Itâs childâs play to put out a funeral talk over some old lady who has
helped the neighbors for seventy or eighty years; but to preach the
need of repentance to the livinâ, and then to smooth things out for
âem after theyâve died in their sins, in such a way as it will jolly
up the survivors and give âem nerve to carve cheerful tidings on the
tombstone, is enough to make a discriminatinâ man sweat his hair out.

The Friar stood with his hands clasped in front of him, and his eyes
fixed sort oâ dreamy-like on the distance. It was a perfect day, one
oâ those days âat canât happen anywhere except in our mountains in the
fall oâ the year, and my mind drifted off to some lines the Friar was
fond of rehearsinâ, âWhere every prospect pleases, anâ only man is
vile.â Then I saw a change come to the Friarâs face, and he began to
chant the one which begins: âLord, let me know mine end, and the
number of my days.â

He chanted slow, and the words didnât mean much to us; but the solemn
voice of him dragged across our hearts like a chain. One line of it
has haunted me ever since. It seems to suggest a hundred thoughts
which I canât quite lay my hand on, and every time I get sad or
discouraged, it begins to boom inside me until I see âat my lot ainât
so much different from the rest; and I buck up and get back in the
game again: âFor I am a stranger with Thee and a sojourner as all my
fathers were.â

The Friar didnât preach us a long talk, and most of it circled about
his favorite text, that a manâs real children were those who inherited
his character, rather than those who inherited his blood. Once he
raised his finger and pointed it at us and sez: âYou were fond oâ this
boy; but did you love him for his good, or did you love him for your
own selfishness? I knew him not save through the dark glass of
reputation; yet after looking into his dead features, to-day, I think
I know him well. Death tells, sometimes, what Life has hid away. I did
not see in his face the hard, deep lines of stealthy sin; I saw the
open face of a child, tired out after a day wasted in thoughtless and
impulsive play; but cominâ home at nightfall to have his small cares
rubbed away by a lovinâ handâand then, to fall asleep.â

Oâ course, the Friar landed on us good and plenty; but this was the
part of his talk which stuck to us after the scoldinâ part was all
forgotten. When he was through he said a short prayer, and sang in a
low tone the one beginninâ, âOne sweetly solemn thought.â His eyes
were glisteninâ through a mist when he finished this, and he climbed
down from the ledge, hurried over to his pinto, and rode off without
sayinâ another word.

We all sat silent for quite a spell, and then Spider and I got up and
nodded good day to âem. The Cross-branders also got up and shook
âemselves, and started down with usâall except Olaf. He sat there on
a stone with his fingers run into his hair, and his face hid in his
hands. Olaf had had regular religion when he was a child; and it had
come back to him up there on the ledge. They say itâs worse ân a
relapse oâ the typhoid fever when it hits ya that way. I know this
much, Olaf was doubled up worse ân if heâd had the colic; and from
that time on, the Ty Jones outfit looked mighty worldly to him.

Even Spider Kelley was savinâ of his nonsense until we got in sight of
the Diamond Dot again.




CHAPTER TWENTY

QUARRELING FOR PEACE


We had a visitor once, which was a business man. One of his chief
diversities was to compare sedentary occupations with what he called
the joyous, carefree outdoor life. He said âat sedentary came from
sedan-chair, and meant to sit down at your work. I rode the range next
spring until I felt more sedentary ân an engineer; and sometimes at
night it used to strain my intellect to split the difference between
myself anâ my saddle.

I got out oâ humor anâ depressed and downright gloomy. Fact is, I was
on the point oâ rollinâ up my spare socks and givinâ Jabez a chance to
save my board money, when I heard a sound âat jerked me up through the
scum and gave me a glimpse oâ the sky again. I was ridinâ in about
dusk, and I had hung back oâ the dust the other fellers had kicked up,
so I could be alone and enjoy my misery, when I heard this inspirinâ
noise.

Olâ Tank Williams once tried to learn to play on a split clarinet a
feller had give him, and at first I thought he had found where we had
buried it, and had resumed his musical studies; but this outrage came
from an instrument a feller has to be mighty cautious about buryinâ.
It was a human voice, and these were the words it was screechinâ:

    âFair Hera caught her wayward spouse
      With a mortal maid one dawn.
    Zeus charmed the maid into a cow,
      To save himself a jawânâ.
    This seemed to me a liber-tee
      To take with poor I-oh;
    But now I find that he was kind,â
      âT was I who did not know.
    For girls use slang and girls chew gum,
      And drape their forms in silk;
    While cows behave with de-co-rum,
      And furnish us with milk.â

Well, I gave a whoop and threw the spurs into my pony. This was the
seventy-ninth verse of Horaceâs song, and it was his favorite, because
it was founded on the Greek religion. I found him perched up behind a
rock, and he kept on slamminâ chunks of his song up againâ the welkin
until I shot some dirt loose above his head; and then he climbed down
and reunioned with me.

He was lookinâ fine, except that some of his waist products had come
back, and we talked into each other until the air got too thin to
breathe. Then we suppered up and began talkinâ again. He had tried all
sorts of gymnastical games back East, from playinâ golf to ridinâ
hossback in a park, but it didnât have the right tang. Folks thought
heâd gone insane anâ lost his mind, the air didnât taste right, he got
particular about how his vittles were cooked; until finally, his
endurance melted and began to run down the back of his neck. This
decided him âat heâd had full as much East as was good for him; so he
loaded up a box with firearms, tossed some clothinâ into a handbag,
and he said his grin had been gettinâ wider all the way out until it
had hooked holes through the window lights on both sides oâ the train.

We were all glad to see him, anâ he dove into ranch life like a
bullfrog into a cream jar; and he got toughened to a hard saddle in a
mighty short time for a feller who had got used to upholstery back
East. He said âat the only thing âat had kept life in him had been to
sing his song constant; but he denied âat this was his main excuse for
fleeinâ from his own range.

He didnât seem to bear a mite oâ malice for the joke I had put up on
him; but still, I have to own up âat he half pestered the life out of
me with his song. He had what he called a tenor voice; but it was the
dolefullest thing I ever heard, and the more he sang, the more his
notes stuck to him until I coveted to hear a love-sick hound
serenadinâ the moon. When he saw it was riskinâ his life to drag out
any more oâ the song, he would pause temptingly, and then begin a
lecture on the Greek religion. He got me all mussed up in religion.

Of course, I knew âat the Injuns had a lot oâ sinful religious idees,
and I was prepared to give the other heathens plenty oâ room to swing
in; but not even an Injun would âaâ stood for as immoral a lot as the
Greek gods anâ goddussesâespecially the top one, which Horace called
Zeus anâ Jove anâ Jupiter.

This one didnât have as much decency as a male goat, and yet he had
unlimited power. He was allus enticinâ some weak-minded human woman
into a scrape; and when his wife, who was called Hera and Juno, would
get onto his tricks, Zeus would snap his fingers, say âFlip!â and
charm the human woman into some sort of an animal. It was a handy
scheme for him, true enough; and he didnât care a scene how
embarrassinâ it was for the human women.

He turned one of âem into a bear, and, like most other women, she was
feared oâ bears anâ wolves anâ snakes, anâ the rest oâ the company she
was forced to associate with. She led a perfectly rotten existence
until her own son went bear huntinâ, and was just on the point of
jabbinâ a spear into her, when even Zeus himself admitted âat this
would be carryinâ the joke a leetle too far; so he grabs âem up and
sticks âem into the sky as a group oâ stars.

Horace tried to argue âat this proved Zeus to be merciful; but as far
as I can see itâs as idiotic as havinâ the law hang a man for murder.
Supposinâ some feller had murdered meâwould I feel any happier
because this feller who couldnât put up with me in this world, is sent
over to pester me in the next? Course I wouldnât; but if one oâ my
friends was murdered, and I had a chance to slay the feller âat did
it, this would give me a lot oâ satisfaction anâ joy anâ
pleasureâthough I donât say it would be just.

Puttinâ the woman anâ her son up in the sky didnât square things in
Horaceâs religion, neither; âcause he said âat Hera got jealous of
Zeus for elevatinâ the woman and she went to her foster parents who
had charge of the ocean, and made âem bar this woman and her son from
ever goinâ into it, the same as the other stars did, and he could
prove it any clear night. I told him that he might get away with such
a tale as that back East among the indoor people; but that he couldnât
fool a day-old child with it out our way.

We started this discussion the day after the fall round-up was over,
Horace had toughened up before it began, and he had rode with me all
through it, and takinâ it all in all he was more help than bother,
except that he shot too much. When he had come out before, he had been
so blame harmless he couldnât have shot an innocent bystander; but
this trip, he was blazinâ away at every livinâ thing âat didnât have a
dollar mark on it, and when these wasnât offered, heâd waste
ammunition on a mark.

I had some details to tend to after the round-up, so we didnât get a
chance to settle the bet for several days. It was only a dollar bet;
but when the time came, I picked out a couple oâ good hosses, beinâ
minded to look at the stars from the top oâ Cat Head.

We reached it about dark, made some coffee, anâ fried some bacon. Then
we smoked anâ talked until it was entirely dark before we ever looked
up at the stars. âNow, bluffer,â sez I, âshow me your woman-bear.â

He looked up at the sky, anâ then moved on out oâ the firelight, anâ
continued to look at the stars without speakinâ. âDonât seem to see
âem, do you?â I taunted.

He turned to me anâ spoke in a hushed voice: âMan,â he said, âthis is
wonderful. Why, the way those stars seem to be hanginâ down from that
velvet dome is simply awe-inspirinâ. Iâve looked through three good
telescopes, but to-night, I seem to be viewinâ the heavens for the
first time.â

âI thought you wasnât much familiar with âem, or you wouldnât have put
out that nonsense about a bear-woman,â I sez.

âThat,â sez he, pointinâ to the best known group oâ stars in the sky,
âis Ursa Major.â

âThat,â sez I, âis the Big Dipper, anâ you neednât try to fool me by
givinâ it one oâ your Greek names.â

He didnât argue with me; but came back to the fire anâ fixed some
stones in the shape of the Big Dipper stars, then drew lines with a
stick, anâ sez âat this made up the Great Bear. I looked him between
the eyes, but he held his face, so I knew he was in earnest. âAll
right,â I sez. âIâll take you huntinâ some oâ these days, anâ if we
chance to come across a silver-tipâa real grizzly, understand, and
not a pet varmint backed up againâ the risinâ sunâyouâll change your
mind about what a bear looks like. If that was all your fool Greeks
knew about wild animals, I wouldnât waste my time to hear what they
had to say about gods anâ goddusses. Iâm goinâ to start back, anâ you
can come or not, just as you please.â This was the first time I had
hinted about the woodchuck; but I was disgusted at his nonsense. He
took it all right, though, which proves he was game.

I rode some cominâ back, anâ he kept tryinâ to square himself; but I
didnât heed him. Just before we reached the foothills, we saw a fire,
anâ when we reached it, the Friar was just finishinâ his supper. He
anâ Horace bowed stiffly to each other, anâ I was just put out enough
by Horaceâs star-nonsense to feel like roastinâ some one; so I decided
to roast âem both.

I sat on my hoss anâ looked scornful from one to the other. âHere is
two religious folks,â I said, impersonal to the pony, but loud enough
for all to hear. âHere is two genuwine religious folks! One of âem is
workinâ for universal brotherhood, anâ the other is peddlinâ Greek
religion which he claims to be founded on beauty anâ love anâ harmony.
They meet in the mountains, anâ bow as cordial as a snow-slide. I
think if ever I pick out a religion for myself, Iâll choose the
Injunâs.â

I couldnât have asked for any two people to look more foolish ân they
did. Neither one of âem seemed to have anything to say; so I said to
my pony: âDonât you worry none, Muggins, I got a match oâ my own, anâ
if we want to set by a fire, why, we can ride on to some place where
wood is free, anâ build us one.â

âWill you not dismount anâ rest a while at my fire?â sez the Friar, in
a tone meant as a slap at me.

âNo, thank you,â sez Horace, âwe must be goinâ.â

âYes, Friar,â I sez hearty. âMe anâ Horace has a bet up, anâ you can
decide it. Also, you owe him somethinâ on his own hook. You drove him
out oâ your religion anâ into the Greek religion; anâ if that donât
give him a direct call on you, why then you donât realize what a pest
the Greek religion is.â

They were so embarrassed they were awkward anâ spluttery; but I was
sure âat this was good for âem, so I got off, threw the reins on the
ground, anâ warmed my hands at the fire; while Horace apologized for
me not knowinâ any better, anâ the Friar assured him coldly that
everything was all right, anâ he was rejoiced to have a little
company.

Well, for as much as ten minutes, we sat around enjoyinâ what I once
heard a feller call frapayed convivuality, anâ then I took pity on âem
anâ loosened things up by tellinâ the Friar about the trip me anâ Tank
anâ Horace had took into the mountains to pacify our nerves, just
before he had stumbled on Horace that other time. Oâ course I didnât
tell it all, as I didnât want Horace to know any more about it than he
knew already; but I told what a seedy little windfall Horace had been
when we started out, anâ how he had come back crackinâ jokes anâ
singinâ the infernalest song âat ever was made up. I finally got
Horace to sing ten or fifteen minutes oâ this song, anâ he droned it
out so unusual doleful that he fetched a chuckle out oâ the Friar, anâ
then we were feelinâ easy anâ comfortable, like outdoor men again.

Then I told the Friar what our bet was, expectinâ oâ course that heâd
back me up; but what did he do but say âat Horace was right as far as
the stars was concerned. This tickled Horace a lot, anâ he began to
crow over me until I concluded to test the Friar; so I sez to Horace
that his religion havinâ been endorsed by the Friar himself, Iâd
become a Greek the first chance I had.

Horace didnât take any trouble to hide his satisfaction, anâ he began
to expound upon the beauty, anâ the art, anâ the freedom of the Greek
religion at a great rate.

âThey certainly was free,â I sez, âanâ easy too, anâ I donât deny âat
they might âaâ been some weight in art anâ beauty; but, confound âem,
they didnât know as much about bears as I know about e-lectricity. Iâd
just like to see Zeus himself go up into the Tetons in the early
spring, to hunt for Big Dippers. Iâll bet the first hungry grizzly
heâd come across would set him right on the bear question.â

This was a good opener, anâ in about two shakes, the Friar anâ Horace
had locked horns. Horace was a crafty, sarcastic, cold-blooded little
argufier; while the Friar was warm anâ eager anâ open as the day. It
was one oâ the best gabbinâ matches I have ever started.

They dealt mostly in names I had never heard of before, although once
in a while theyâd turn up one a little familiar on account of Horace
havinâ told me some tale of it. The Friar knew as much about these
things as Horace did; but he called âem myths, anâ said while they
didnât mean anything when took literal, they had great historical
value when regarded merely as symbols. He said that I-ohâthe human
maid which Zeus had turned into a cowâwas nothinâ but the moon, anâ
that Argus of the hundred eyes was simply the sky full oâ stars; and
that the old god which ate up his children was nothinâ but time.

I didnât really understand much of what they said; but I did enjoy
watchinâ âem bandy those big words about. We all use a lot oâ words we
donât understand; but as long as they sound well anâ fill out a gap it
donât much matter. These two, though, seemed to understand all the
words they used, anâ I was highly edified.

As they talked, anâ I kept watchinâ the Friarâs face, I learned
somethinâ: the Friar had been mighty lonesome with only us rough
fellers to talk with, anâ had been hungerinâ for just such a confab as
this to loosen up his subsoil a little.

Every now anâ again, Iâd cast an eye up to the stars; anâ while I
didnât know the religious names of âem, I knew how to tell time by
âem; anâ I knew âat those two would have a turn when they remembered
to look at their watches. It was full one oâclock when the
conversation came to its first rest, anâ then the Friar recalled what
I had said when I had dismounted; so he up anâ asked Horace
point-blank what he had had to do with makinâ Horace quit the church.

Horace was minded to sidestep this at first by intimatinâ that I was
not responsible for what I said; but he finally came across and told
the Friar that he had give up that church for about the same reason
that the Friar himself had. This set the Friar back purty well on his
haunches, anâ put him on the defensive. He had hammered Horace freely
before, but now when he conscientiously tried to defend the gang he
had left, and also excuse himself for leavinâ, he had some job on his
hands.

I thought Horace had him when he compared the Golden Age of Greece anâ
Platoâs Republic with the Dark Ages, which was a stretch of years when
the Christian religion about had its own way; but the Friar admitted
that what he called economical interests had put a smirch on the
church durinâ the Dark Ages, anâ then he sailed into the Golden Age of
Greece, showinâ that slavery was the lot of most oâ the decent people
durinâ that period. When I fell asleep, they were shakinâ their fists
friendly at one another, about Platoâs Republic, which I found out
afterwards was only a made-up story.

Beinâ edicated is a good deal like beinâ a good shot in a quiet
communityâonce in a long while itâs mighty comfortinâ, but for the
most part itâs nothinâ but shootinâ at a target.




CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

PEACE TO START A QUARREL


It was broad day when I woke upâthat is, the sun was beginninâ to
riseâanâ the fire had dwindled to coals, the breeze had begun to stir
itself, anâ I was considâable chilly. I saw the Friarâs nose stickinâ
out oâ one side of his tarp anâ Horaceâs nose stickinâ out the other,
anâ I grinned purty contentedly.

My experience is, that quarrelsome people usually get along well
together anâ make good company; but sad, serious, silent, polite folks
is about the wearinâest sort of an affliction a body can have about.

I once heard a missionary preach about what a noble thing it was to
control the temper. He must have been a good man, âcause he was
unusual solemn anâ wore his hair long anâ oily; but he only looked at
one side oâ the question. Iâve known fellers who had such good control
oâ their tempers that after theyâd once been put out oâ humor over
some little thing, they could keep from beinâ good tempered again for
a year. And then again, when a feller keeps too tight a holt on his
temper, his hands get numb, anâ his temperâs liable to shy at some
silly thing anâ get clear away from him.

What I liked about both the Friar anâ Horace was, âat they hadnât
froze up all their feelinâs. It was possible to get âem stirred up
about things, anâ this allus struck me as beinâ human; so I was glad
to see Horace warminâ his feet in the small oâ the Friarâs back, anâ I
whistled a jig under my breath while gettinâ breakfast.

They grumbled considâable when I rousted âem out; but by the time they
had soused their heads in the crick, they were in good humor again;
anâ hungry! Say! Ever since Iâd give him his treatment, Horace had had
an appetite like a stray dog; while the Friar allus was a full hand at
clearinâ tables, except on his one off-day a week. I gave the Friar a
wink just as Horace splashed into his third cup oâ coffee, anâ sez:
âFriar, you should have seen this creature when he first came out
here. His muscles had all turned to fat, so that he could hardly
wobble from one place to another, anâ he was so soft that when heâd
lie down at night, his nerves would stick into him anâ keep him awake.
Now, if it wasnât for that fringy thing he wears on his face, heâd
look almost exactly like a small-sized human.â

The only come-back Horace made was to start to sing with his mouth
full oâ cornbread anâ bacon. This was more ân any one could stand, so
I tipped him over backward, anâ asked the Friar which way he was
headinâ.

The Friarâs face went grave at once; and then he began to post me up
on Olaf the Swede. I had heard some rumors that summer, but hadnât
paid much heed to âem. It now turned out that the Friar and Olaf had
struck up friendly affiliations; so he was able to give me all the
details.

Badger-face had a disposition like a bilious wolf, and when he was
denied the satisfaction oâ jerkinâ Olaf out oâ this world, he had
turned to with earnest patience to make Olaf regret it as much as he
did. Olaf could stand more ân the youngest son in a large family oâ
mules, but he had his limitations, the same as the rest of us; so when
he saw that Badger was engaged in makinâ the earth no fit place for
him to habitate, he began to feel resentful.

When a boss is mean, he is still the boss and he donât irritate beyond
endurance; but a foreman is nothinâ but a fellow worker, after all; so
when he gets mean, heâs small and spidery in his meanness; and I
reckon âat Olaf was justified in tryinâ to unjoint Badger-face,
thorough and complete.

Oâ course, Ty had to back up Badger for the sake oâ discipline; but he
didnât wreak any vengeance on Olaf when he tendered in his
resignation, which proves âat Ty still was full oâ respect for Olaf.
Badger was groaninâ on his back when Olaf left; but he called out that
he intended to get square, if he had to wear all the curves off his
own body to do it.

Olaf had the gift oâ sensinâ men, all right; but his judgment wasnât
such as to make a yearlinâ bull willinâ to swap, and what he did was
to take the Pearl Crick Spread as a homestead. It was only about
fifteen miles from the Cross brand ranch house, and it was one oâ the
choicest bits in the whole country. This act was on a par with an
infant baby sneakinâ into a wolf den to steal meat. The Friar put the
finishinâ touch by sayinâ that Olaf had bought the old, run-down T
brand, and then I lost patience.

âDoes Olaf sleep with a lightninâ rod connected to the back of his
neck?â I asked as sober as a boil.

âWhat do ya mean?â asked the Friar, who was innocent about some
things.

âWell, that looks like another good way to attract trouble,â sez I.

âOlaf does not want any trouble,â sez the Friar with dignity. âAll he
wants is an opportunity to work his claim in peace. He has more
self-control ân airy other man Iâve ever known.â

âItâs a handy thing to have, too,â sez I, âprovidinâ a feller knows
how to use it. Why, ya could change a T brand to a Cross quicker ân a
one-armed Mexican could roll a cigarette. Ty Jonesâll get more oâ that
brand ân ever Olaf will. How is Kit Murray gettinâ along?â

âShe is a fine girl,â sez the Friar, his face lightinâ. âShe has cut
out all her wild ways, and Mother Shipley sez her daughter thinks as
much of her as if they was sisters. I got word last week âat her
husband died in a hospital; and I hope sheâll marry Olaf some day.â

âWell, Iâll bet the liquor againâ the bottle âat she never does it,â
sez I. âIn the first place, sheâs got too much style, and in the
second, sheâs got too much sense. Tyâs already got more stuff ân he
can take care of through a dry summer, and the next one we have, he is
goinâ to need Pearl Crick Spread. A grizzly traffics along without
beinâ disturbed, until he gets the idee that he owns considâable
property, and has legal rights. Then one day theâ donât seem to be
anything else demandinâ attention, so out go a parcel oâ men and
harvest the grizzly. Thatâs the way itâll be with Olaf.â

âI advised him to move,â sez the Friar; âbut heâs set in his ways.â

âSelf-control,â sez I. âI was workinâ in a mine once with a mule and a
Hungarian; and both of âem had an unusual stock oâ self-control. One
day right after a fuse had been lit, the mule decided to rest near the
spot; anâ the Hun decided to make the mule proceed. We argued with âem
as long as it was safe; but the mule had his self-control anâ all four
feet set, and the Hun was usinâ _his_ self-control anâ a shovel.
All we ever found was the muleâs right hind leg stickinâ through the
Hungarianâs hat, and we buried these jusâ as they was.â

The Friar sighed, pursed up his lips, and sez: âI wish I could help
him.â

âHelp him all you can, Friar,â sez I; âbut after the fuse is burninâ,
you pull yourself out to safety. Ty Jones could easy spare you without
goinâ into mourninâ.â

The Friar rode on about his business, anâ me anâ Horace went back to
the ranch, him pumpinâ me constant for further particulars about Olaf
anâ Kit. âHorace,â sez I finally, âdid you ever see these folks?â

âI never did,â sez he.

âThen,â sez I, âwhat you got againâ âem âat you want âem to marry?â

âMarriage,â sez he with the recklessness common to old bachelors, âis
the proper condition under which humans should liveâand besides, I
donât like what you tell about Ty Jones.â

From that on, Horace began to talk hunt; and when Horace talked
anything, he was as hard to forget as a split lip. He had brought out
some rifles which the clerk had told him would kill grizzlies on
sight, and Horace had an awful appetite to wipe out the memory oâ that
woodchuck.

I admit that no one has any right to be surprised at anything some one
else wants to do; but I never did get quite hardened to Horace Walpole
Bradford. When ya looked at him, ya knew he was a middle-aged man with
side-burn whiskers; but when ya listened to his talk, he sounded like
a fourteen-year-old boy who had run away to slaughter Injuns in
wholesale quantities.

All of his projecs were boyish; he purtâ nigh had his backbone bucked
up through the peak of his head before heâd give in that ridinâ mean
ones was a trade to itself; and the same with ropinâ, and several
other things. It ground him bitter because his body hadnât slipped
back as young as his mind, anâ he worked at it constant, tryinâ to
make it so.

He wore black angora chaps, two guns, silver spurs, rattlesnake
hat-band, Injun-work gauntlets, silk neckerchief through a silver
slip, leather wristlets, anâ as tough an expression as he could work
up; but the one thing of his old life he refused to discard was his
side-burns. Sometimes heâd go without shavinâ for two weeks, anâ weâd
all think he was raisinâ a beard; but one day heâd catch sight of
himself in a lookinâ-glass, anâ then heâd grub out the new growth anâ
leave the hedge to blossom in all its glory.

We were long handed for the winter as usual, anâ theâ wasnât any
reason why we couldnât take a hunt; so Tank anâ Spider egged him on,
anâ I wasnât much set againâ it myself. Horace agreed to pay us our
wages while we were away, anâ offered Jabez pay for the hosses; but oâ
course he wouldnât listen to it; and for a few days he even talked
some oâ goinâ with us, though he didnât ever care much for huntinâ.

Finally we started out with a big pack train anâ enough ammunition for
an army. Besides me anâ Horace, theâ was Tank, Spider Kelley, Tillte
Dutch, anâ Mexican Slim. Slim was to do the cookinâ, anâ the rest of
us were to divvy up on the other chores all alike, Horace not to be
treated much different simply because he was payinâ us our wages; but
he was to have the decidinâ vote on where we should go anâ how long
weâd stay. It was fine weather most oâ the time, though now anâ again
weâd get snowed up for a day or so in the high parts.

I had allus felt on friendly terms with the wild creatures; anâ I had
told him before we started that I wouldnât have no part in usinâ
hosses for bear-bait, nor shootinâ bears in traps, nor killinâ a lot
oâ stuff we had no use for; but Horace turned out to be as decent a
hunter as I ever met up with, anâ after the second day out he did as
little silly shootinâ as any of us. He wasnât downright blood-thirsty,
like a lot of âem who get their first taste too late in life. He cared
more for the fun oâ campinâ out anâ stalkinâ game than he did for
killinâ. We only got one silver-tip, most of âem havinâ holed up; but
we found all the other game we wanted. Horace killed the grizzly,
which was a monster big one, and this wiped the woodchuck off his
record, and inflated his self-respect until the safety valve on his
conceit boiler was fizzinâ half the time.

We made a permanent camp not far from Olafâs shack, anâ it didnât take
me long to see âat the foxy Horace was more interested in Olaf anâ his
war with Ty Jones than he was in huntinâ. As soon as we had our camp
arranged, he got me to take him over to Pearl Crick Spread to call on
Olaf. I told him that Olaf wasnât what youâd call sociable; but he
insisted, so we went.

We found Olaf in an infernal temper, anâ some tempted to take it out
on the first human he met; but this didnât phaze Horace. He thought he
could start Olaf by tellinâ him that Kit Murray was a widow; but the
Friar had already told him and Olaf wouldnât thaw worth a cent. He
kept on askinâ questions, even when they wasnât answered, until Olaf
got hungry anâ asked us in to eat dinner with him. After we had eaten,
we sat around the fire smokinâ, anâ Horace looked as contented as a
cat. He kept at his questioninâ until he got Olaf to talkinâ freer ân
I had supposed he could talk.

Horace tried him out on all sorts oâ things, anâ when Olaf snubbed
him, why, he just overlooked it anâ tried somethinâ else. Finally he
tried his hand at religion, anâ this was what loosened Olaf up. Now
Olaf was actually religious, and called himself a Christian, but theâ
was a heap oâ difference between his brand oâ it anâ the Friarâs.

Olafâs God took more solid satisfaction in makinâ hell utterly
infernal than a civilized community takes in a penitentiary; anâ Olaf
was purty certain as to who was goinâ there. When he got to talkinâ
religion in earnest, his face grew hard anâ his eyes bright, anâ he
gloated over the souls in torment till he showed his teeth in a grin.
Theâ wasnât any doubt in his mind that Ty Jones was goinâ to be among
those present, anâ this led him into tellinâ what had put him so far
out oâ humor before weâd come along.

He had found another one of his cows shot anâ only a couple oâ steaks
cut off. He fair frothed at the mouth when he told us this, anâ he
didnât make any bones of givinâ Ty the credit for it. He cut loose anâ
told us a string oâ things âat he knew about Ty, anâ ya couldnât blame
him for feelinâ sore. He talked along in a rush after he got started,
tellinâ oâ the way âat Ty changed brands anâ butchered other fellersâ
stock anâ wasnât above takinâ human life when it stood in his way. âHe
made me as big a devil as he is,â sez Olaf; âanâ now he knows âat I
canât get any backinâ; so he is just persecutinâ me; but some oâ these
days, Iâll get a chance at him.â

Horace had dropped into a silence while Olaf was talkinâ; but now he
raised a finger at me, anâ said: âIâll tell you what weâll do: instead
of huntinâ ordinary wild beasts, weâll just keep watch on Olafâs
stuff, anâ when any one bothers it, why, weâll take âem into some town
with a jail.â

Olaf shook his head, anâ I told Horace that theâ wasnât any law for
big cattle men; but Horace was all worked up, anâ after weâd left Olaf
anâ started for camp, he didnât talk of anything else. He put it
before the boys; but they were all againâ it, anâ told him a lot oâ
tales about fellers who had tried to buck the big cattle men. Horace
called us all cowards; but we only laughed at his ignorance anâ let
him carry on as far as he liked. He sat up way into the night broodinâ
over it, anâ from that on he did a lot oâ scoutinâ on his own hook. We
used to keep an eye on him, though; so after all he had his own way
about it, anâ Olafâs stuff was watched purty close.

The boys was proud of Horace, just as theyâd have been proud of a
fightinâ terrier; but they was worried about him, too, in just about
the same way.

âI tell you, that little runt would shoot to kill if he got a chance,â
sez Tank Williams, one night while Horace was away.

âAw ya canât tell,â sez Spider. âHe thinks he would; but heâs never
been up against it yet, anâ ya canât tell.â

âWell, what if he did shoot,â sez Slim, âwe wouldnât have to mix in,
would we?â

âYou know blame well weâd mix in,â sez Tank, âanâ you canât tell where
it would end. If Horace had âaâ come out here when he was a kid, heâd
âaâ turned out one oâ the bad men for true. Itâs in his blood. Look at
him! when he came here first, he didnât have no more get-up ân a sofy
piller; but look what heâs gone through since. I saw him, myself,
march along without food for four days, anâ when we came up with that
cow, he was willinâ to help kill her with a rock or strangle her to
death, anâ he didnât make no more bones oâ calf-milkinâ her than a
coyote would. He started out in life with more devilment in him ân any
of us, anâ what heâs achinâ for now is a mix-in with the Cross brand
outfit. Thatâs my guess.â

âAnâ thatâs my guess,â I chimed in; but just then we heard two shots
close together, then a pause anâ three more shots. We jammed on our
hats anâ guns anâ rushed outside. It was a moonlight night, anâ we
hustled in the direction oâ the shots. Before long we made out Horace
anâ Tillte Dutch cominâ towards us, anâ Horace was struttinâ like
Cupid the bulldog used to walk, after heâd flung a steer. It was the
first time Iâd ever noticed this, but I noticed it plain, out there in
the moonlight.

âWhatâs up?â I asked.

âI reckon âat somebody knows by now that Olafâs stuff is havinâ a
little interest took in it,â sez Horace.

We came back into the old log cabin where we was campinâ, anâ Dutch
told about how Horace had got him to walk with him, anâ had sat down
on a rock where they could see Olafâs little bunch oâ cattle grazinâ.
He said âat Horace sat with his rifle across his lap and kept watch
like an Injun scout.

After a time they saw two men creep out of a ravine not far from where
they was sittinâ anâ sneak down on the bunch oâ cows. One of âem had
shot a cow, anâ Horace had shot him, bringinâ him down, but not
killinâ him. The two had run for the ravine, anâ Horace had tried to
cut âem off, anâ he had gone along âcause Horace had; but the two had
got to their hosses first. Each oâ the two had taken one shot, anâ
Horace had shot back but none oâ these last shots had hit anything,
anâ the two had got away.

âIâll bet they havenât got so far away but what weâll hear from âem
again,â sez Tank.

âThe thing for us to do is to start back to the Diamond Dot,â sez I.

âWe shall stay here, anâ see what happens,â sez Horace, lightinâ his
pipe. His eyes were dancinâ anâ he was all puffed up. I didnât say any
more. I just looked at him. He was the same old Horace, side-burns anâ
all; but still theâ was enough difference for me to begin to regret
havinâ give him the treatment. I had cured his nerve so complete it
seemed likely to boss the whole crowd of us into trouble.




CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

A PROGRESSIVE HUNT


The Friar sez itâs all rot about men beinâ better for havinâ sowed
their wild oats when young. He sez âat itâs utter foolishness to sow
any crop ya donât want to harvest; but I dunno. I donât mind havinâ a
colt try to turn himself inside out with me on its back; but Iâm some
prejudiced againâ an old hoss which is likely to pitch when Iâve got
other business to attend to. When a young hoss is mean, why, ya can
reason it out of him; but when an old hoss turns bad, you might just
as well put the outlaw label on him anâ turn him adrift.

We couldnât do a thing with Horace after heâd taken his shot at the
feller who potted one of Olafâs cows. Olâ Tank Williams was huge in
size anâ had a ponderous deep voice which rumbled around in him like a
bulldog croakinâ in a barrel; anâ he decided that it was his duty to
be firm with Horace, seeinâ the way âat he had bluffed him when we
went on that trip for the nerves; so the follerinâ morninâ he put a
scowl on his face, grabbed Horace by the chest of his shirt, lifted
him so âat nothinâ but the tips of his toes touched, anâ sez: âLook
here, you little whippersnapper, we agreed to go where you said anâ
stay as long as you said; but we meant on a game-huntinâ trip. You
havenât any idee what youâre up againâ out here, anâ you got to give
in anâ come back with us.â

Tankâs free eye rolled about in his head, runninâ wilder ân Iâd ever
seen it; but Horace wasnât as much phazed as if a fly had bit him. He
scowled down his eyebrows, anâ piped out in his squeaky tenor: âTake
your hand off me, Tankâand take it off now.â

âIâve a notion to raise it up anâ squash ya,â sez Tank.

âYes,â sez Horace, without blinkinâ a winker, âyouâve got notions all
right; but they lie so far to the interior of ya that they generally
weaken before they find their way out. Take your hand off me.â

Well, Tank was beat. He gave Horace a shove, but Horace was light on
his feet, anâ he never lost his balance. He just danced backward until
he had his brakes set, anâ then he fetched up in front oâ the fire,
put his fists on his hips, anâ stared up at Tank haughty.

âIgnorance,â sez he, âis the trouble with most people. The ignorant
allus judge by appearances. If body-size was what really counted, why,
weâd have an elephant for an emperor. Instead of which we use âem to
push logs around. Goliath did a lot oâ talkinâ about squashinâ David,
but as soon as David got around to it, he fixed Goliath all ready for
the coroner. Napoleon was of small size, anâ fat, anâ nervous, but he
didnât count it a fair dayâs work unless he had presented one of his
relatives with a full-sized kingdom. Where are the buffalosâwhere are
theyâthe big clumsy brutes! Theyâre shut up out oâ harmâs way, thatâs
where they are; but where are the mosquitoes? Why the mosquitoes are
takinâ life easy at all the fashionable summer resorts. If you feel
like freightinâ your big, fat carcass back to where it donât run any
risk oâ beinâ bumped into, why go ahead; but Iâm goinâ to stick around
here anâ see what happens.â

Well, there we were: we didnât none of us have the courage to own up
âat we were afraid of anything âat Horace wasnât afraid of; so we
decided to stick with him, but that he had to take the blame. It was
Tillte Dutch who said this, anâ Horace looked at him anâ grinned.
âTake the blame?â sez he. âWhy you big chump, itâs the small-sized men
who allus take the blame. The big boobs rush about, makinâ a lot oâ
noise; but they only do what the small-sized men tell âem to. Iâll
take the blame all right, anâ if you back me up, youâll be right
pleased to have a share in the kind oâ blame theâs goinâ to be. This
Ty Jones outfit is nothinâ but a set oâ cowardly bullies who sneak
around in the dark doinâ underhanded work; but I intend to let the
daylight in.â

âIâll bet the daylight will be let in, somewhere,â sez I; âbut Iâm
just fool enough to stick with ya.â

Tank was still smartinâ from the way it had been handed to him. âSay,â
sez he, âpâraps you donât know it; but that David you was cacklinâ
about a while ago wasnât nothinâ but a sheep-herder.â

âThat donât change no brands,â sez Horace, who didnât have any more
use for a sheep-herder ân we did. âHe was a small-sized man, anâ he
just drove sheep a while to help his father out. Sheep-herdinâ wasnât
his regular trade. Bossinâ men anâ fightinâ anâ beinâ a king was his
natural line oâ business. It allus seems to me âat big, overgrown men
ought to be sheep-herders, so they could drive about in house-wagons,
anâ not wear down so many good hosses.â

Olâ Tank slammed about, makinâ a lot oâ noise; but he had lost this
deal, anâ it was plain to see.

âIâm goinâ to ride over to Olafâs, anâ tell him about what happened
last night, anâ say âat weâll keep an eye on his stuff if so be he
wants to take a little trip to Billings,â said Horace; and when he
started I went along with him. At first Olaf was so white-hot about
havinâ another cow killed that he couldnât think; but finally he
looked at Horace a long time, anâ said: âYou have very brave flame,
anâ you speak true. I shall go to Billings, anâ trust everything with
you.â

I was flabbergasted clear out oâ line at this; but Olaf packed some
stuff on one hoss, flung his saddle on another, anâ set off at once.
Now, I knew Olaf to be slow anâ stubborn, anâ I couldnât see through
this.

After Olaf had rode out oâ sight to the north, Horace sez: âHas he
allus been crazy?â

âHeâs not crazy,â sez I.

âThen what did he mean by sayinâ I had a very brave flame anâ that I
spoke true?â sez Horace. âCourse heâs crazy. Didnât you notice his
eyes.â

âYes,â I sez, âIâve noticed his eyes a lot; but I donât think heâs
crazyâexcept in thinkinâ âat Kit Murrayâll marry him. Why, she would
as soon think oâ marryinâ a he-bear as Olaf.â

âWell, I think they have drove him crazy,â sez Horace; âbut Iâm goinâ
to bestir myself in his favor.â

He took himself as serious as if he had been Napoleon anâ David both;
anâ I could smell trouble plain. We decided to move our camp down to
Olafâs, anâ wrangle his herd into the Spread every night. Pearl Crick
Spread was as fine a little valley as a body ever saw; filled with
cottonwoods anâ snugglinâ down out oâ the wind behind high benches.
The crick came in through a gorge, anâ went out through a gorge; anâ
it was plain to me that the Spread was worth fightinâ for.

When we got back to the camp we found that a couple oâ Cross brand
boys had happened along, by accident, of course, anâ were tryinâ to
swap news oâ the weather for news oâ the neighbors. Our crowd hadnât
loosened up none; and as soon as we came back the Cross-branders left.

Horace looked pleased. âI bet I got one of âem last night,â sez he,
shakinâ his head.

Well, we all grinned, we couldnât help it. âI bet you get another
chance at âem, too,â sez Slim. Our outfit had been peaceable for so
long that the prospect of trouble actually made us feel nervous enough
to show it.

We moved down to Olafâs, and each night we fetched in his little bunch
oâ cows, anâ allus kept up some hosses in the corral. The
Cross-branders used to wander by our place purty frequent, but allus
in the matter oâ business.

One day, after weâd been livinâ at Olafâs about a week, Badger-face
Flannigan, anâ a pair of as mean-lookinâ Greasers as ever I saw, came
ridinâ along. Me anâ Horace had been up in the hills after some fresh
meat, anâ we see them before they saw us. They were ridinâ slow anâ
snoopinâ about to see what they could pick up, anâ when they saw us
they looked a bit shifty for a moment.

Then Badger wrinkled up his face in what was meant for a friendly
grin, anâ sez: âHello, fellers. Have you-unâs bought Olaf out?â

âNope,â sez I. âWeâre just out here for a little huntinâ; anâ Olaf got
us to look after his stuff for a few days while he went visitinâ.â

âWasnât theâ any huntinâ closer to home?â sez Badger-face, a little
sarcastic.

âNot the kind oâ huntinâ we prefer,â sez Horace, sort oâ dreamy like.

Badger-face drilled a look into Horace, who had put on his most
no-account expression. âWhatâs your favorite game,â sez he, âsnow-shoe
rabbits?â

âOh, no,â drawled Horace as if he felt sleepy, âsilver-tips anâ humans
is our favorite game; but oâ course the spring is the best timeâfor
silver-tips.â

âWhere might you be from?â asked Badger-face.

âI might be from Arizona or Texas,â sez Horace; âbut I ainât. Iâm a
regular dude. Canât you tell by my whiskers?â

Badger-face was so puzzled when Horace gave a little rat-laugh that I
had to laugh too; and ya could see the blood come into Badgerâs
cheeks, but still, he couldnât savvy this sort oâ game, so he couldnât
quite figure out how to start anything.

Horace had practiced what he called a muscle-lift, which he said he
used to see the other kids do on parallel bars; and now he slipped to
the ground anâ tightened his cinch anâ cussed about the way it had
come loose, as natural as life. Then he put one hand on the horn anâ
the other on the cantle anâ drew himself up slow. He kept on pushinâ
himself after his breast had come above the saddle until he rested at
armâs length. Then he flipped his right leg over, anâ took his seat as
though it was nothinâ at all. Any one could see it was a genuwine
stunt, though it was of no earthly use to a ridinâ man.

Now, just because theâ was no sense to this antic, it made more of an
impression on Badger-face than the fanciest sort oâ shootinâ or ropinâ
would âaâ done; anâ he puzzled over what sort of a speciment Horace
might be, till it showed in his face.

âCome on down anâ have supper with us,â sez Horace. âYou can see for
yourself what the prospect for fresh meat is; so you can be sure of a
welcome.â

âNo, we canât very well come this eveninâ,â sez Badger-face.

âWhy not?â sez Horace. âYou look to me like a man who was gettinâ
bilious for the want of a little sociability. Come on down anâ weâll
swap stories, anâ have a few drinks, anâ Iâll sing ya the best song
you ever hearkened to.â

âNo, we got to be goinâ,â sez Badger-face; anâ he anâ the Greasers
rode off while Horace chuckled under his breath as merry as a magpie.

âThatâs what you call a bad man, is it?â sez he. âI tell you that
fellerâs a rank coward.â

âWould you have the nerve to pick up a horn-toad?â sez I.

âNo,â sez he; âcause theyâre poison.â

âThey ainât no more poison ân a frog is,â I sez; âbut most people
thinks they are, anâ that is why strangers are afraid of âem. Now,
Badger-face ainât no coward. Heâs a shootinâ man; but he canât make
you out, anâ this is what makes him shy of ya.â

âWell,â sez Horace, âIâd rather be a free horn-toad than a mule in
harness. Come on, letâs go eat.â

The next afternoon Horace went along to help bring in the bunch oâ
cattle; anâ some one up on the hill took a shot at him. He couldnât
ride up the hill, so he hopped off the pony, anâ started up on foot.
Mexican Slim was closest to him, anâ he started after; but the feller
got away without leavinâ any trace. Horace was wonderful pleased about
it, anâ strutted more than common.

âThere now,â sez he after supper; âdo you mean to tell me âat that
feller wasnât a coward? Why theâ ainât enough sand in their whole
outfit to blind a flea!â

We just set anâ smoked in silence. When a feller as little as him once
begins to crow, theâs nothinâ to do but wait till his spurs get
clipped.




CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

A LITTLE GUN-PLAY


Itâs curious how hard it is, sometimes, to get trouble started. We all
knew âat the Cross-branders was ready to clean us out, anâ itchinâ for
the job; but theâs one curious little holdback in the make-up of every
healthy animal in the world. Every sane animal theâ is wants
self-defence as his excuse for takinâ life. I admit that now and again
beasts anâ men both get a sort oâ crazy blood-lust, anâ just kill for
the sake of it; but itâs the rare exception.

One of us allus made it a point to go along with Horace; anâ most
times when weâd meet up with any oâ the Cross-branders, theyâd never
miss the chance to fling some polite smart talk at him; but the little
cuss could sass back sharper ân they could, anâ I reckon they was
suspicious that he wouldnât âaâ been so cool if he hadnât had bigger
backinâ than was in sight. It was perfectly natural to think âat he
had been sent out as a lure by some big cattle outfit, or even the
government; so they went cautious till they could nose out the game.

One day Badger-face anâ the two Greasers came along when Horace was
out ridinâ with Tillte Dutch. Dutch was one oâ these innocent-lookinâ
Germansâbig, wide-open eyes, a half smile, anâ a sort of a leaninâ to
fat. He never had but one come-back to anythingâwhich was to
splutter; but he was dependable in a pinch.

âWhatever made you so unspeakable little?â sez Badger-face to Horace.

Horace looked behind him, anâ all about, anâ then sez in surprise:
âWho, me?â

âYes, you,â sez Badger-face. âYou seem to dry down a little smaller
each day.â

âWell,â sez Horace, speakinâ in a low secret-tellinâ tone, âIâll tell
ya; but I donât want ya to blab it to every one ya see. When I was a
young chap, I used to go with a big, awkward, potato-brained slob,
about your size. I could out-shoot him, out-ride him, run circles
around him, anâ think seven times while he was squeezinâ the cells of
his brain so theyâd touch up againâ each other; but one day he made a
bet that he could eat more hog-meat ân I could; anâ he won the bet.
When I found out that theâ was one single thing âat this big,
loose-jointed galoot could beat me at, I felt so blame small that I
never got over it, anâ this is why I disguise myself in these
whiskers.â

The two Greasers couldnât help but grin, anâ the fool Dutchman
sniggered. This was more ân Badger-face could stand. He shot his hand
across anâ pulled his gun quick as a flash; but Horace didnât move, he
just sat still, with a friendly smile on his face; anâ Badger-face sat
there with his gun in his hand, scowlinâ jerk-lightninâ at him.

Spider anâ Slim had gone after meat that day, anâ they came into view
with the carcase of a doe, just as Badger drew his gun. Me anâ Tank
was listed to wrangle in the bunch, anâ we came ridinâ along just
after the other two came into view. The Greasers gave a little cough
anâ Badger-face looked up anâ saw us. It looked like a put-up job, all
right; anâ chariots of fire, but he was mad! Pullinâ a gun on a man is
the same as shootinâ at him. Badger-face had been tricked into givinâ
us just grounds to slaughter him, and he wasnât quite sure what move
to make next. Our outfit had been purty well advertized, through
cleaninâ out the Brophy gang, me anâ Mexican Slim were both two-gun
men anâ known to be quick anâ accurate, while Tank was ever-lastinâly
gettinâ into trouble, owinâ to his friendly feelinâs for liquor. As we
drew closer we made our smoke-wagons ready, while his two Greasers
kept their hands in plain view, and harmless.

Badger had a trapped look in his face; but he didnât say anything, anâ
he didnât cover Horace with his gun; he just held it ready. We did the
same with ours, anâ it was the foolest lookinâ group I was ever part
of. Olâ Tank was the one who finally started things. âLook here,
Badger-face,â he bellowed, âif you so much as harm a hair oâ those
blamed olâ whiskers, why, weâll have to put ya out oâ business.â

Horace turned anâ looked at Tank in surprise. âAw, put up your gun,â
he said. âBadger-face ainât in earnest. We had an argument the other
day: I said âat a man lost time crossinâ his hand to pull his gun, anâ
he said it could be done quicker that way ân any other; so to-day he
joked me about beinâ as small in the body as he is in the brain, anâ I
came back at him, also jokinâ in a friendly way; anâ he took this
excuse to pull his gun on me, without any ill intent; but only to
prove how quick he could do it. It stuck in his holster, though; anâ
if weâd been in earnest, Iâd have had to kill him. Iâve had him
covered all this time; but you can see for yourselves âat his gun
ainât cocked. Now put up your guns, and next time, donât be silly.â

I know âat Horace didnât have any gun in his hand when we came up; but
when he stopped speakinâ, he pulled his hand with a cocked gun in it
out from under his hossâs mane, anâ Badger-face was the most surprised
of any of us.

âCome on down to supper, Badger-face, anâ Iâll sing ya my song,â sez
Horace. âWe allus seem to have fresh deer meat when you happen along.â

We all put up our guns along with Badger-face, anâ he mumbled some
sort of an excuse anâ rode away with the Greasers. Oâ course weâd
ought to âaâ killed him right then, âcause he was more full oâ hate
than a rattler; but the simple truth was, that Horace had gained
control over us complete, anâ we let him have his way.

âWhen did you get that gun in your hand, Horace?â I sez to him after
supper. âYou didnât have no gun when I rode up.â

âThatâs whatâs puzzlinâ Badger-face right this minute,â sez Horace. âI
didnât draw that gun until Tank made his talk; but at the same time I
wasnât as defenceless as I looked. I have told you all the time âat
that man didnât have the nerve to harm me. Heâs a coward.â

âI reckon youâll be killed one oâ these days, still believinâ that,â
sez olâ Tank. âHow much fightinâ experience have you ever had?â

âHow much did Thesis ever have?â asked Horace.

âNever heard of him,â sez Tank. âWho was he?â

âHe was a Greek hero,â sez Horace. âHe never had had a fight till he
started out to go to his father; but he cleaned out all the toughs
along the way, anâ when he reached his father, who was king of Athens,
he found âem just ready to send out seven young men anâ seven maidens,
which they offered up each year to the Minnietor, which was a beast
with the body of a man, and the head of a bull, just like Badger-face.
Thesis volunteered, anâ what he did was to kill the Minnietor anâ end
all that nonsense.â

âWell, I never heard tell oâ that before, anâ I donât more ân half
believe it now,â sez Tank; âbut Iâm willinâ to bet four dollars âat
the Minnietor didnât know as much about gunfightinâ as what
Badger-face does. Heâll get ya yet, you see if he donât.â

âTell ya what Iâm game to do,â sez Horace. âIâm game to go right to Ty
Jonesâs ranch house alone. Do ya dare me?â

âNo, you donât do that,â sez I. âThatâs a heap different proposition.
Ty Jones wouldnât pull his gun without shootinâ; and besides, heâd
most likely set his dogs on ya.â

âWell, I own up âat I donât want no dealinâs with dogs,â sez Horace,
thoughtful. âDogs havenât enough imagination to work on. If theyâre
trained to bite, why, thatâs what they do; but give a human half a
chance, anâ heâll imagine a lot oâ things which are not so. You
couldnât tell Badger-face a big enough tale about me to make him doubt
it. I tell ya, I got him scared.â

We didnât argue with him none; theâ was some doubt about him havinâ
Badger-face fooled; but theâ wasnât any doubt about him havinâ himself
fooledâwhich is the main thing after all, I reckon. Anyway, we let
Horace sit there the whole eveninâ, tellinâ Greek-hero tales which
must have blistered the imagination oâ the feller âat first made âem
up.

Along about nine oâclock we began to stretch anâ yawn; but before we
got to bed, Mexican Slim said âat he heard a noise at the corral, anâ
we all looked at one another, thinkinâ it was the Cross-branders; but
Horace was the first one to get back into his boots anâ belt; anâ he
also insisted on beinâ the first to open the door, which he did as
soon as we blew out the candle. Then we all filed out anâ sneaked down
toward the corral; but first thing we knew, a voice out oâ the dark
whispered: âThis is meâOlaf. Is everything all right?â

We told him it was, anâ he whistled three times. You could âaâ knocked
me down with a feather when Kit Murray anâ the Friar came ridinâ up;
anâ then we turned the ponies loose anâ went into the house. It only
had two rooms, countinâ the lean-to kitchen, anâ we made considâable
of a crowd; but we were all in good spirits, on account of Olaf
gettinâ the girl anâ us beinâ able to hand him back his stuff with not
one head missinâ.

It had been some interval since Iâd seen Kit Murray, anâ I was
surprised to view the change in her. She didnât look so much older,
but all the recklessness had gone out of her face, anâ it had a sort
of a quiet, holy look about it. âKit,â I sez, âI wish ya all the joy
theâ is; but Iâd âaâ been willinâ to have bet my eyes âat youâd never
take Olaf. I was glad to see him go up after ya, âcause gettinâ
knocked on the head is some better ân beinâ kept hanginâ on a hook;
but you sure got your nerve with ya. This homestead is purty likely to
get in some other folksâ way.â

Kit had as snappy a pair oâ black eyes as was ever stuck in a face;
and now they flashed out full power. âI know itâs goinâ to be hard to
hold this place,â sez she, âbut I reckon I can help a little. I can
ride anâ shoot as well as a man, if I have to, and you know it. I
donât want anything but the quietest sort of a life theâ is; but Iâm
ready to stand for any sort oâ luck âat comes along. As for Olaf, heâs
the only man in the world for me. I saw something oâ the big cities
back east, anâ Billings, anâ the boys on the range here, and out of
âem all, Olafâs my man. The thing I hope more ân anything else is,
that we can die together.â

Her voice caused a hush to come to the room. I had meant to be jovial
anâ hearty; but theâ was an undercurrent of earnestness in her voice
which put a tingle into a feller. Kit Murray had changed a heap, but
all for the better.

Olaf cleared his throat, anâ we all took a look at him. He had
changed, too. He had lost the chained-bear look he generally wore, anâ
theâ was a light oâ pride anâ satisfaction in his face which was good
to look upon. âBoys,â he said, âIâve been purty tough anâ unsociable,
anâ I donât see why youâve took so much trouble for me; but I tell ya
right here that I stand ready to square it in any way or at any time I
can. Now, it seems mighty funny âat Kit Murray should love me, anâ I
canât account for it any more ân you can; but I knew right from the
start that she did love meâI could tell by the light. If ever the
time comes that she donât love me any more, I get out of her way,
thatâs all about that; but Iâm not goinâ to make her stay here any
longer ân I have to. I sell out when I get the first chance. Friar
Tuck, he softened my heart, anâ he watched over her. Heâs a man.
Thatâs all I can say.â

Well, this was an all-around noble speech for a stone image like Olaf
had been, anâ we cheered him to the echo; but Horace had sort oâ been
jostled to the outside anâ forgot. Now, he come forward anâ shook Olaf
by the hand anâ congratulated him, anâ sez: âTheâs one thing Iâd like
mightily to know, anâ that isâwhat the deuce do you mean by this
light youâre allus alludinâ to?â

Olaf was some embarrassed; but it never seemed to fuss Horace any when
he had turned all the fur theâ was in sight the wrong way; so he just
waited patiently while Olaf spluttered about it.

âI donât know myself,â sez Olaf. âAlways, since I was a little child,
I have seen a floating light about people. I thought every one saw
this light anâ I spoke of it when I was a child anâ asked my mother
about it many times; but at first she thought I lie, anâ then she
thought my head was wrong; so I stopped talkinâ about it; but always I
see it anâ it changes with the feelings and with the health. All the
colors and shades I cannot read, but some I know. I knew that Kit
Murray loved me before she knew it, and I knew that the Friar was a
true man when they told me tales of him. Animals, too, have this
floatinâ light about âem, anâ I can tell when they are frightened anâ
when they are mean. This is why I handle hosses without trouble. Now I
do not know why my eyes are this way; but I have told you because you
have been good friends to me. I do not want you to tell of this
because it makes people think I am crazy.â

âCourse it does,â sez Horace. âIt made me think you were crazy. I
never heard of anything like this before. Tell me some more about it.â

âThere is no more to tell,â sez Olaf. âWhen I see the flame I do not
see the people. The flame wavers about them, and sometimes I have seen
it at night, but not often. I do nothing to make myself see this way.
Always my eyes did this even when I was only a baby.â

âWell, you have everything beat I ever saw yet,â sez Horace. âWhat do
you think oâ this, Friar?â

âI never heard of such a case,â sez the Friar; âalthough it may have
been that many have had this gift to some extent. I think it is due to
the peculiar blue of Olafâs eyes. I think that this blue detects
colors or rays, not visible to ordinary eyes. I wish that some
scientist would study them.â

âIâll pay your way back East, Olaf,â sez Horace, âif youâll have your
eyes tested.â

âNo, no,â sez Olaf, shakinâ his head. âI donât want to be a freak.
What is the use? I can not tell how I do it, so it cannot be learned;
and I do not want things put into my eyes for experiments. No, I will
not do it.â

âTell me how Badger-face looks to you,â sez Horace.

âOh, he is bad,â sez Olaf. âHe has the hate color, he loves to kill;
but he is like the wolf; he does not like the fight, he wants always
to kill in secret.â

âI bet my eyes are a little like yours,â sez Horace, noddinâ his head.
âI knew âat Badger-face was this way as soon as I saw him.â

âOh, here now,â sez the Friar. âYou are puttinâ down a special gift to
the level of shrewd character-readinâ.â

âWhat sort of a flame does a dead person have, Olaf?â sez Horace.

A queer look came into Olafâs face, a half-scared look. âA dead person
has no flame,â sez he, with a little shudder. âIt is a bad sight. I
have watched; I have seen the soul leave. When a man is killed, the
savage purple color fades into the yellow of fear, then comes the
blue, it gets fainter and fainter around the body; but it gathers like
a cloud above, and then it is silver gray, like moonshine. It is not
in the shape of the body, it is just a cloud. It floats away. That is
all.â

âWell, thatâs enough,â sez Horace. âCan you see any flame about a
sleeping person?â

âYes,â sez Olaf, âjust like about a waking person; and there is marks
over a wound or a sick place.â

âWell, Mrs. Svenson,â sez Horace to Kit, âyouâll have to be mighty
careful or your husband will find you out.â

âI am perfectly willinâ,â sez Kit with a proud little smile. She was
game, all right, Kit was.

âThat is why I say it is all right,â sez Olaf. âShe is young, she
cannot know how she will change. If ever she no longer love me, I will
not bother her. That would be a foolishness; but so long as she love
me, no other man will bother her. That would be devilishness!â

âYou certainly have a nice, simple scheme of life,â sez Horace. âIf
ever you change your mind, Iâll put up the money to take you back
East, anâ pay you high wages.â

âNo,â sez Olaf, âI hate circuses anâ shows, anâ such things. I not
go.â

âYou say you can tell sick places, anâ fear, anâ hate, anâ honesty,â
sez Horace. âNow, when I came out here, I was just punk all over. You
give me a look-over, anâ tell right out what you see.â

At first Olaf shook his head, but we finally coaxed him into it; anâ
he opened his eyes wide anâ looked at Horace. As he looked the blue in
his eyes got deeper anâ deeper, like the flowers on the benches in
June, then when the pupil was plumb closed, the blue got lighter
again, and he said: âYou have not one sick point, you have good
thoughts, you are very brave, you are too braveâyou are reckless. You
have very great vitality, anâ will live to be very oldâunless you get
killed. I knew an old Injunâover a hundred years old he wasâhe had a
flame like yours. It is strange.â

You could actually see Horace swellinâ up with vanity at this; but it
made olâ Tank Williams hot to see such a fuss made about a
small-caliber cuss; so he rumbles around in his throat a minute, anâ
sez: âWell, you fellers can fool around all night havinâ your souls
made light of, if ya want to; but as for me Iâm goinâ to bed.â

Kit insisted that we sleep on the floor just as we had been, while she
anâ Olaf bunked in the lean-to; but a warm chinook had been blowinâ
all day, anâ it was soft anâ pleasant, so we took our beds out in the
cottonwoods. Horace anâ the Friar got clinched into some kind of a
discussion; but the rest of us dropped off about as soon as we
stretched out. The moon was just risinâ, anâ one sharp peak covered
with glitterinâ snow stood up back oâ the rim. I remember thinkinâ it
might be part oâ the old earthâs shiny soul.




CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

NIGHT-PROWLERS


Whenever theâs anything on my mind I sleep purty light; anâ the whole
Cross brand outfit was on my mind that night; so itâs not surprisinâ
that I woke up after a bit. The moon had climbed considâable, anâ the
stars told me it was about two. I had been sleepinâ alone; Horace
havinâ decided to crawl in with the Friar so they could quarrel at
short range.

The Friarâs tarp was next to mine, anâ I raised myself on my elbow anâ
looked at it. I could hear him breathinâ natural, anâ the bulk of him
was so large that Horace wouldnât have made much of a mound anyway; so
at first I couldnât tell whether he was there or not. I crept out till
I could sit up anâ get a clear view; but Horace wasnât there, so I put
on my boots as quick as ever.

I sneaked over to the Friarâs tarp; but Horaceâs hat was gone, so I
knew he was up to some mischief, anâ started for the corral to see if
he had taken a hoss. What I feared was, that he had got to thinkinâ
about what a super-wonderful flame he had, and had decided to give it
a fair work-out by sneakinâ down to Ty Jonesâs on his own hook. I was
worried about this because I knew theyâd do for him in a minute, if
theyâd catch him where they could hide all traces.

Olaf had built a large square corral anâ a smaller round one, to do
his ropinâ in; and when I reached the near side oâ the square one, I
heard a slight noise near the gate of the round one. I peered through
the poles of the corral, but the dividinâ fence got in the road so âat
I couldnât see, anâ I started to prowl around. All of a sudden,
Horaceâs squeaky tenor piped out: âHaltâ; anâ I flattened out on the
ground, thinkinâ he had spotted me; but just then theâ was a smothered
curse from the round corral, anâ when I started to get up I saw
Badger-face vault over the fence in the direction of Horaceâs voice.

Then I saw Horace standinâ behind a clump with his gun on Badger-face.
âPut up your hands,â sez Horace.

Badger was runninâ straight for him; but he put up his hands at this
order, and came to a slow stop about five feet from Horace. The square
corral was still between me anâ them, anâ I drew my right gun anâ
started around, keepinâ my eye on âem as much as I could through the
poles.

âI reckon I got ya this time,â sez Horace, just as I reached the
corner.

âI reckon you have,â sez Badger in a give-up voice; but at the same
moment he took a step forward, threw his body back, anâ kicked the gun
out of Horaceâs hand. Then he lunged forward anâ got Horace by the
throat, flung him on his back anâ straddled himâanâ I broke for âem
on the run. Just before I reached âem, theâ came a heavy, muffled
report, anâ Badger-face fell on his side anâ rolled over on his back,
clutchinâ at his breast.

Horace rose to his feet, holdinâ a toy pistol, put his hands on his
hips, looked down at Badger-face, anâ sez: âIf youâd âaâ just asked
Olaf what kind of a light I give out, youâd âaâ stayed at home anâ
saved your life.â Thatâs how nervous Horace was.

âDonât stand anâ talk to a shot man,â I sez. âAllus get his gun
first.â

Horace gave a jump at the sound oâ my voice, anâ covered me with his
pop-gun. âOh, itâs you, is it?â he sez. âWell, then, you get his gun;
but I donât much think he can use it.â

By the time I had lifted Badgerâs gun, the other boys were arrivinâ,
anâ when they found that Horace had gone out alone anâ shot a hole
through Badger-face, they certainly was some surprised. Purty soon Kit
Murray came out with Olaf, anâ then Horace told about not feelinâ
sleepy anâ beinâ so disgusted at the way we were snorinâ that he had
got up to take a little stroll. He said he just went toward the corral
âcause that was the least uninterestinâ place he could think of, and
that Badger had sneaked down anâ started to cut the stirrups off the
saddles right before his eyes.

âI gave him all the time he wanted,â sez Horace, âso âat there
wouldnât be any doubt as to his intentions. I reckon âat cuttinâ up
saddles in another manâs corral is goinâ about far enough, ainât it?â

Just then the Friar finished his examination of Badger, anâ went after
his saddle bags for a bandage. âWent clear through his lung,â was all
he said as he passed us on the run.

It was purty chilly at that time oâ night; and as the cold began to
eat in, it suddenly came over Horace that no matter how much justified
he was, he had shot anâ most likely killed a feller human, anâ he
began to shake. He went over to Badger-face anâ put his coat over him,
anâ sez: âGreat heavens! are ya goinâ to let this man lie out here in
the cold till he dies? Ainât theâ some place we can put him? This is
horrible.â

âBring him in the house,â sez Kit. âHe donât deserve it; but we canât
let him lie out hereâcan we, Olaf?â

âNo,â sez Olaf. âIf you say bring him in, in he comes.â

âThatâs right, thatâs fine. I donât bear him any malice,â sez Horace.
âI hope he gets over it anâ lives to repent.â

We packed him into the house anâ Kit made a fire anâ heated some
water. As soon as the water was hot, the Friar cleaned out the wound
with it anâ some foamy stuff out of a bottle. Then he dissolved a drab
tablet in some water anâ tied up both openings. Horace sat in a corner
durinâ this operation, with his head in his hands, shiverinâ. The
reaction had set in; anâ all of us knew what it was, though I donât
suppose any of us had had the chance to give way to it as free as
Horace did.

Badger-face was all cut anâ scarred when we stripped him; but he
looked as tough anâ gnarly as an oak tree, anâ the Friar said he had
one chance in a hundred to pull through. He didnât speak to us until
after the Friar had finished with him. Then he said in a low, snarly
voice: âI donât much expect to get over this; but before I slip off, I
wish youâd tell me who the little cuss who got me really is, anâ
whatâs his game.â

We didnât hardly know what to say; but finally Tank sez: âWe donât
feel free to tell you who he is, Badger-face; but Iâll say this much,
he ainât no officer of the law.â

I thought it would be the quickest way to straighten Horace up, so I
told him âat Badger-face wanted to talk to him. Sure enough, Horace
took a deep breath anâ stiffened his upper lip. Then he walked over to
the bed. âHow do ya feel, Badger-face?â sez he.

âOh, I been shot before,â sez Badger; âbut it burns worse ân usual
this time, anâ I reckon youâve got me. It grinds me all up to think
âat a little runt like you did it, anâ it would soothe me to know âat
you had some sort of a record.â

Horace looked thoughtful: he wanted to comfort the man he was
responsible for havinâ put out oâ the game; but he could see that the
whole truth wouldnât in no wise do, so he put on a foxy look anâ sez:
âI never worked around these parts none; but if youâve ever heard oâ
Dinky Bradford, why, thatâs me. I know just how you feel. You feel as
much put out at beinâ bested by a small-like man, as I would at havinâ
a big feller get ahead oâ me; but you neednât fret yourself. Thereâs
fellers right in this room who have seen me go four days without food
anâ then do a stunt which beat anything theyâd ever seen. Donât you
worry none. Now that youâre down anâ out, we all wish ya the best oâ
luck.â

Me anâ Spider anâ Tank had to grin at this; but it was just what
Badger needed to quiet him, anâ his face lit up when he asked Horace
how he had managed to shoot him.

âI used my auxilary armyment,â sez Horace, but thatâs all the
explanation heâd make. I found out afterward that he had a thing
called a derringer, a two-barreled pistol, forty-one caliber, which he
carried in his vest pocket. I told him âat this sneaky sort of a
weapon would give him a bad name if it was found out on him; but he
said âat he shot from necessity, not choice, and that when it came to
gettinâ shot, he couldnât see why the victim should be so blame
particular what was usedâwhich is sensible enough when you come to
think it over, though I wouldnât pack one oâ those guns, myself.

Badger-face was out of his head next day, and for two weeks followinâ.
The Friar anâ Kit anâ Horace took turns nursinâ him, anâ they did an
able job of it. Water, plain water anâ wind, was about all the Friar
used in treatinâ him. Kit wanted to give him soup anâ other sorts oâ
funnel food; but the Friar said âat a man could live for weeks on what
was stored up in him; anâ Horace backed him up. Kit used to shake her
head at this, anâ I know mighty well that down deep in her heart, she
thought they would starve him to death before her very eyes.

We tore up the old shack on the hill, snaked the poles down with
Olafâs work team, anâ set it up in the Spread; so âat weâd be handy in
case we was needed. A couple oâ the Cross-branders drifted by, anâ we
gave âem the news about Badger-face anâ Dinky Bradford havinâ come
together anâ Badger havinâ got some the worst of it; but they wouldnât
go in to see him, anâ they quit wanderinâ by; so âat we didnât hardly
know what to expect.

We had hard work thawinâ out the clay for chinkinâ, anâ we didnât get
the cabin as tight as weâd âaâ liked; but we had plenty oâ wood, so it
didnât much matter as far as warmth was concerned; but we had the
blamedest time with a pack-rat I ever did have.

I donât know whether pack-rats anâ trade-rats is the same varmints or
not; but neither one of âem has a grain oâ sense, though some tries to
stick up for the trade-rats on account oâ their tryinâ to be honest. A
pack-rat is about three times as big as a barn rat, anâ fifteen times
as energetic. His main delight is to move things. Horace said âat he
was convinced they were the souls oâ furniture-movers who had died
without repentinâ of all the piano-lamps anâ chiny-ware they had
broke. A pack-rat donât care a peg whether he can use an article or
not; all he asks is the privilege of totinâ it about somewhere.

We werenât at all sure âat we wouldnât be routed out in the night; so
when we went to sleep, weâd stack our boots anâ hats where we could
find âem easy. Sometimes the pack-rat would toil so industrious âat
heâd wake us up anâ weâd try to hive him; but most oâ the time heâd
work sly, anâ then next morninâ weâd find our boots all in a heap on
the table, or in the corner under the bunk or somewhere clear outside
the shack; until we was tempted to move the shack back where it was,
there not beinâ any pack-rats up there.

Then either the pack-rat reformed into a trade-rat, or else he sold
out his claim to a trade-rat. Anyway, four nights after weâd been
settled, we began to get trades for our stuff.

Horace was sleepinâ this whole night with us, anâ next morninâ he
wakened before light anâ started to dress so as to relieve the Friar.
He had put his boots on the floor under the head oâ his bunk, anâ when
he reached down for âem he found one potato anâ the hide of a rabbit.
The rabbit hide had been tossed out two days before, anâ it had froze
stiff anâ had a most ungainly feel at that hour oâ the morninâ. Horace
scrooged back into bed anâ pulled all the covers off Tank whom he was
sleepinâ with. When Tank awoke, he found Horace sittinâ up in the bunk
with the covers wound around him, yellinâ for some one to strike a
light.

We all struck matches anâ finally got a candle lit. When Horace saw
what it was, he was hos-tile for true, thinkinâ it was a joke one oâ
the boys had put up. We had had a hard time convincinâ him oâ the ways
oâ pack-rats, anâ now when we sprung trade-rats on him, he thought we
were liars without mercy; but when the Friar came out to learn what
the riot was, anâ told Horace it was all so about trade-rats, he had
to give in.

âWell, theyâve got a heap oâ nerve,â sez he, from the center oâ the
beddinâ which was still wound around him, âto lug off a good pair oâ
high-heeled ridinâ boots, anâ leave an old potato anâ the shuck of a
rabbit in place of âem!â

After this Horace took a tarp into Badgerâs room anâ bedded himself
down in a corner, which was all around the most handy thing he could
do; but the rest of us had a regular pest of a time with that rat. We
couldnât find out where the deuce he got in; but he distributed our
belonginâs constant, anâ generally brought us some of Olafâs
grub-stuff in exchange. We couldnât trap him nor bluff him, anâ it
generally took a good hour morninâs, to round up our wearinâ apparel.

One night we kept the fire goinâ anâ changed watchers every two hours.
Olâ Tank was on guard from two to four, anâ he woke us up by takinâ a
shot. We found him on his back in the middle oâ the floor, anâ he
claimed he had been settinâ in a chair anâ had seen the rat walkinâ
along the lower side oâ the ridgepole with one oâ Tillte Dutchâs boots
in his mouth. Dutch had the spreadinâest feet in the outfit, anâ we
couldnât believe âat a trade-rat could possibly tote it, hanginâ down
from the ridgepole; but Tank showed us a lot oâ scratches along the
ridgepole, anâ a bruise on his chin where the boot had hit him when
the rat dropped it. Theâ was also a hole in the boot where his bullet
had gone, but this didnât prove anything. Still, Tank stuck to his
story, so we had to apologize for accusinâ him of lettinâ his good eye
sleep while he kept watch with his free one.

We stuffed burlap into the hole about the ridgepole, anâ that night
beinâ Christmas eve, we all gathered in and held festivities. We
danced anâ told tales anâ sang until a late hour. None of us were
instrument musicians; but we clapped our hands anâ patted with our
feet, anâ Kit took turns dancinâ with us, till it was most like a
regular party. Mexican Slim bet that he could do a Spanish dance as
long as Horace could sing different verses of his song; but we
suppressed it at the ninety-first verse. Tank wanted to let him
finish, in the hope it might kill the trade-rat; but we couldnât stand
any more, ourselves.

Then the Friar taught us a song called, âWe three Kings of Orient
areâ; anâ we disbursed for the night. It was a gorgeous night, anâ me
anâ the Friar took a little walk under the stars. One of âem rested
just above the glisteny peak up back oâ the rim, anâ he sang soft anâ
low, the âStar of beauty, star of nightâ part oâ this song. He allus
lifted me off the earth when he sang this way. Then he sez to me:
âAfter all, Happy, life pays big dividends, if we just live it hard
enoughâ; anâ he gave a little sigh anâ went in to tend to Badger-face.




CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

THE TRADE-RATâS CHRISTMAS-GIFT


Trade-rats havenât as much idee of real music as coyotes have.
Ninety-one verses of that infernal cow-song, sung in Horaceâs
nose-tenor, was enough to drive bed-bugs out of a lumber-camp; but
that night the trade-rat worked harder than ever. We had hid our stuff
anâ fastened it down, anâ used every sort of legitimate means to
circumvent the cuss; but he beat us to it every time, anâ switched our
stuff around scandalous.

âMerry Christmas!â yelled Spider Kelley, holdinâ up a rusty sardine
can.

The trade-rat had remembered us all in some the same way, but we
recalled what day it was anâ took it in good part; until, all of a
sudden, olâ Tank gave a whoop, anâ held up a brown buck-skin bag. We
crowded around anâ wanted him to open it up anâ see what was inside;
but he said it most probably belonged to Olaf or Kit or the Friar; so
we toted it into the cabin anâ asked the one who could identify it to
step out anâ claim his diamonds.

Then we had a surpriseânot one oâ the bunch could identify the bag!
We stood around anâ looked at the bag for as much as five minutes,
tryinâ to figure out how the deuce even a trade-rat could spring stuff
on us none of us had ever seen before.

âThis is a real trade, sure enough,â sez Horace.

âI tell ya what this is,â sez I. âThis is a Christmas-gift for the
Friar. Go on anâ open it, Friar.â

Theâ was some soft, Injun-tanned fawn-skin inside, wrappinâ up a
couple oâ papers, anâ two photographs, and an old faded letter. âI
donât think we have the right to look at these,â sez the Friar.

âHowâll we ever find out who they belong to, then?â asked Horace.
âLook at the letter anyway.â

It was in a blank envelope, anâ it began, âMy dear son,â and ended,
âYour lovinâ mother.â The letter was just the same as all mothers
write to their sons, I reckon: full of heartache, anâ tenderness, anâ
good advice, anâ scoldinâ; but nothinâ to identify nobody by; so we
said âat the Friar should read the papers. One of âem was an honorable
discharge from the army; but all the names anâ dates anâ localities
had been crossed out. It was what they call an âExcellentâ discharge,
which is the best they give, anâ you could tell by the thumb print âat
this part had been read the most by whoever had treasured it.

The other paper was simply a clippinâ from a newspaper. It was a
column of items tellinâ about Dovey wishinâ to see Tan Shoes at the
same place next Sunday, anâ such things. The Friar said âat this was
the personal column, anâ he sure labeled it; âcause if a feller chose
to guess any, some oâ those items was personal enough to make a
bar-tender blush; but they didnât convey any news to us as to where
the trade-rat had procured the buck-skin bag.

The photographs were wrapped in tissue paper anâ then tied together
with pink string, face to each. The Friar balked a little at openinâ
âem up; but we deviled him into it. The first he opened was a cheap,
faded little one of an old lady. She had a sad, patient face, anâ
white hair. Horace was standinâ on a chair, lookinâ over the Friarâs
shoulder, anâ he piped out that the photograph had been took in New
York, anâ asked if we knew any one who lived there, which most of us
did; but not the subject of the photograph.

Then the Friar opened the other one. He took one look at it, anâ then
his face turned gray. âThis one was took in Rome,â sez Horace. âDoes
any one here have a list oâ friends livinâ in Rome, Italy?â

He hadnât looked at the face on the photograph, nor at the Friarâs
face; but when we didnât answer, he looked up, saw that we had sobered
in sympathy with the Friar, anâ then he looked at the face on the
photograph anâ got down off the chair. The face was of a beautiful
lady in a low-necked, short-sleeved dress. Not as low nor as short as
some dresses Iâve seen in pictures, but still a purty generous
outlook.

The Friarâs hands shook some; but he gradually got a grip on himself,
anâ purty soon, he sez in a steady voice: âThis is a picture of
Signorina Morrissena. Does any one here know of her?â

Well, of course none of us had ever heard of her; so the Friar wrapped
up the package again anâ put it back into the buck-skin bag. We had
expected to have some high jinks that day, anâ Kit had baked a lot oâ
vinegar pies for dinner, we had plenty oâ fresh deer-meat, anâ we had
agreed to let the Friar hold a regular preachinâ first; but when we
saw how the picture had shook him up we drifted back to our own shack
anâ sat talkinâ about where the deuce that blame trade-rat could
possibly have got a holt oâ the buck-skin bag. I was purty sure that
it was a picture oâ the Friarâs girl, the extra trimminâs on the name
not beinâ much in the way of a disguise, anâ as soon as I got a chance
to see Horace I questioned him, anâ he said it was the girl, all
right; but that she had developed a lot.

The Friar had taken a hoss anâ gone up into the mountains, anâ had
left word that he didnât want any dinner. We were as full oâ sympathy
with him as we could stand, but not in the mood to sidestep such a
meal as Kit had framed up; so we ate till after three in the
afternoon. We didnât want to do anything to fret him a speck; so we
hardly knew what to do. Generally it tickled him to have us ask him to
preach to us; but we couldnât tell how heâd feel about it now, and we
were still discussinâ it about the fire when the Friar came back.

He looked mighty weary, anâ we knew he had been drivinâ himself purty
hard, although it wasnât just tiredness which showed in his face.
Still, theâ was a sort of peace there, too; so after heâd warmed
himself a while, olâ Tank asked him if he wouldnât like to preach to
us a bit.

The Friar once said that back East some folks used good manners as
clothinâ for their souls, but that out our way good-heartedness was
the clothinâ, anâ good manners nothinâ more than a silver band around
the hat. âAnd some oâ the bands are mighty narrow, Friar,â I added to
draw him out. âYes,â sez he, âbut the hats are mighty broad.â

You just couldnât floor the Friar in a case like this. He knew âat the
politeness anâ the good-heartedness in Tankâs request was divided off
about the same as the band anâ the hat; and that all we wanted was to
ease off the Friarâs mind anâ let him feel contented; so he heaved a
sigh and shook his head at Tank.

When a blacksmith goes out into company, folks donât pester him with
questions as to why tempered steel wasnât stored up in handy caves,
instead of havinâ nothinâ but rough ore hid away in the cellar of a
mountain; and a carpenter is not held responsible because a sharp saw
cuts better ân a dull one; but it seems about next to impossible for a
human beinâ to pass up a parson without insultinâ him a little about
the ways oâ Providence, and askinâ him a lot oâ questions which would
moult feathers out oâ the ruggedest angel in the bunch.

We could all see âat the Friar had been havinâ a rough day of it; so
Tank began by askinâ him questions simply to toll him away from
himself; but soon he was shootinâ questions into the Friar as rough
shod as though they was both strangers to each other.

âYou say it was sheep-herders what saw the angels that night the Lord
was born,â sez Tank. âHow come theâ wasnât any cow-punchers saw âem?â
Tank had about the deep-rootedest prejudice againâ sheep-herders I
ever saw.

âTheâ wasnât any cow-punchers in that land,â sez the Friar. âIt was a
hilly land anâââ

âWell Iâd like to know,â broke in olâ Tank, âwhy the Lord picked out
such a place as that, when he had the whole world to choose from.â

Oâ course the Friar tried his best to smooth this out; but by the time
he was through, Tank had got tangled up with another perdicament.
âThen, there was olâ Faroâs dream,â he said, âthe one about the seven
lean cows eatinâ the seven fat ones. Iâve punched cows all my life,
and I saw âem so thin once, when the snow got crusted anâ the chinook
got switched off for a month, that the spikes on their backbones
punched holes through their hides; but theyâd as soon thought oâ
flyinâ up anâ grazinâ on clouds, as to turn in anâ eat one another.â

By the time the Friar had got through explaininâ the difference
between dreams and written history, Tank was ready with another query.
âI heard tell once âat the Bible sez, âIf thy eye offends thee, pluck
it out.â Does the Bible say this?â

âWell, it does,â admitted the Friar; âbut you seeââ

âWell, my free eye offends me,â broke in Tank. âIt never did offend me
until Spike Groogan tried to pluck it out, and it donât offend me now
as much as it does other folks. Still, I got to own up âat the blame
thing does offend me whenever I meet up with strangers, âcause it
allus runs wilder in front of a stranger ân at airy other time. Now,
what I want to know is, why anâ when anâ how must I pluck out that
eyeâspecially, when it sez in another place that if a manâs eye is
single his whole body is full oâ light. My eye is single enough to
suit any one. Fact is, itâs so blame single that some folks call it
singular; but theâ ainât no more light in my body ân there is in airy
other manâs.â

You couldnât work off any spiritual interpretation stuff on Tank. He
thought an allegory was the varmint which lives in the Florida swamps.
Well, as far as that goes, I did, too, until the Friar pointed out
that it was merely a falsehood used to explain the truth; but Tank, he
didnât join in with any new-fangled notions, anâ a feller had to talk
to him as straight out as though talkinâ to a hoss. Theâ was lots of
times I didnât envy the Friar his job.

But after he had satisfied Tank that it wasnât required of him to
discard either of his lamps, especially the free one, he drifted off
into tellinâ us how he had spent the dayâand then I envied him a
little, for he certainly did have the gift oâ wranglinâ words.

He told about havinâ rode up the mountain as far as he could go, and
then climbinâ as far as he could on foot. He showed how hard it was to
tell either a man or a mountain by the lines in their faces, and he
went on with this till he made a mountain almost human. Then he
switched around and showed how much a mountain was like life, ambition
beinâ like pickinâ out the mountain, the easy little foothills beinâ
the start, the summit allus hid while a feller was climbinâ, and each
little plateau urginâ him to give up there and rest. He compared life
and a mountain, until it seemed that all a feller needed for a full
edication, was just to have a mountain handy. Then he wound up by
sayinâ that he hadnât been able to reach the peak. He had sat in a
sheltered nook for a time, gazinâ up at the face of a cliff with an
overhanginâ bank oâ snow on top, the wind swirlinâ masses oâ snow down
about him, and everything tryinâ to point out that he had been a
failure, and might as well give up in disgust. He stopped here, and we
were all silent, for, as was usual with him, he had led us along to
where we could see life through his eyes for a space.

âAfter a time,â sez the Friar as soon as he saw we were in the right
mood, âI caught my breath again and followed the narrow ledge I was on
around to where I could see the highest peak stand out clear and
solitary; and from my side of it, it wasnât possible for any man to
reach it. There was no wind here, the air was as sweet and pure as at
the dawn oâ creation, and everywhere I looked I met glory heaped on
glory. A gray cloud rested againâ the far side oâ the peak, and back
oâ this was the sun. Ah, there was a silver and a golden lininâ both
to this cloud; and all of a sudden I was comforted.

âI had done all I could do, and this was my highest peak. Whatever was
the highest peak for others, this was the highest peak for me; and
there was no more bitterness or envy or doubt or fear in my heart. I
stood for a long time lookinâ up at the gray cloud with its dazzling
edges, and some very beautiful lines crept into my memoryââThe paths
which are trod, by only the eveninâ and morninâ, and the feet of the
angels of God.ââ

The Friar had let himself out a little at the end, and his eyes were
shininâ when he finished. âI guess I have given you a sermon, after
all, boys,â he said, âand I hope you can use it to as good advantage
as I did when it came to me up on the mountain. We all have thoughts
we canât put into words, and so Iâve failed to give you all âat was
given me; but itâs some comfort to know that, be they big or be they
little, we donât have to climb any mountains but our own, and whether
we reach the top or whether we come to a blind wall first, the main
thing is to climb with all our might and with a certain faith that
those who have earned rest shall find it, after the sun has set.â

This was one of the days when the magic of the Friarâs voice did
strange things to a fellerâs insides. We knew âat he was talkinâ in
parables, anâ talkinâ mostly to himself; but each one of us knew our
own little mountains, anâ it was darn comfortinâ to understand that
the Friar could have as tough a time on his as we had on ours.

We all sat silent, each feller thinkinâ over his own problems; and
after a time, the Friar sang the one beginninâ, âO little town of
Bethlehem!â It was dark by this time, but the firelight fell on his
face, anâ made it so soft-like anâ tender that olâ Tank Williams
sniffled audible once, anâ when the song was finished he piled a lot
more wood on the fire, anâ pertended âat he was catchinâ cold. When
Kit called us in to supper, we all sat still for a full minute, before
we could get back to our appetites again.




CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

A CONTESTED LIFE-TITLE


The bullet which had gone through Badger-face hadnât touched a single
bone. It had gone through his left lung purty high up, but somethinâ
like the pneumonie set in, anâ he was a sorry lookinâ sight when the
fever started to die out after havinâ hung on for two weeks. He had
been drinkinâ considâable beforehand, which made it bad for him, anâ
the Friar said it was all a question of reserve. If Badger-face had
enough of his constitution left to tide him over, he stood a good
chance; but otherwise it was his turn.

He didnât have much blood left in him at the end of two weeks on air
and water, and he didnât have enough fat to pillow his bones on. We
all thought âat he ought to have something in the way oâ feed; but the
Friar wouldnât stand for one single thing except water. He said âat
food had killed a heap more wounded men ân bullets ever had; so we let
him engineer it through in his own way.

When the fever started to leave, he got so weak âat Horace thought he
was goinâ to flicker out, anâ he felt purty bad about it. He didnât
regret havinâ done it, anâ said he would do just the same if he had it
to do over; but it calls up some mighty serious thoughts when a fellow
reflects that he is the one who has pushed another off into the dark.
On the night when it seemed certain that Badger-face would lose his
grip, we all went into his room anâ sat around waitinâ for the end, to
sort oâ cheer him up a little. Life itself is a strange enough
adventure, but death has it beat a mile.

Along about nine oâclock, Badger said in a low, trembly voice: âWhatâd
you fellers do to me, if I got well?â

He didnât even open his eyes; so we didnât pay any heed to him. When
he first got out of his head, he had rambled considâable. Part oâ the
time he seemed to be excusinâ himself for what he had done, anâ part
oâ the time he seemed to be gloatinâ over his devilment; but theâ
wasnât any thread to his discourse so we didnât set much store by it.
After waitinâ a few minutes, he quavered out his question again, anâ
the Friar told him not to worry about anything, but just to set his
mind on gettinâ well.

Badger shook his head feebly from side to side anâ mumbled, âThat
donât go, that donât go with me.â He paused here for a rest, anâ then
went on. âIâve been in my right mind all day, anâ Iâve been thinkinâ a
lot, anâ tryinâ some experiments. I can breathe in a certain way which
makes me easier anâ stronger, anâ I can breathe in another way which
shuts off my heart. I donât intend to get well merely for the pleasure
oâ gettinâ lynched; so if thatâs your game, I intend to shut off my
heart anâ quit before I get back the flavor oâ life. It donât make
two-bits difference with me either way. What dâ ya intend to do?â

He had been a long time sayinâ this, anâ we had exchanged glances
purty promiscuous. We hadnât give a thought as to what we would do
with him, providinâ he responded to our efforts to save his life; but
it was purty generally understood that Badger had fitted himself to be
strung up, just the same as if he hadnât been shot at all. Now,
though, when we came to consider it, this hardly seemed a square deal.
There wasnât much common sense in chokinâ a manâs life down his throat
for two weeks, only to jerk it out again at the end of a rope, anâ we
found ourselves in somethinâ of a complication.

âWhat do ya think we ort to do to ya?â asked Tank.

âLynch me,â sez Badger, without openinâ his eyes; âbut I donât intend
to wait for it. I donât blame ya none, fellers. I did ya all the dirt
I could; but I donât intend to furnish ya with no circus
performanceâIâm goinâ on.â

He began to breathe different, anâ his face began to get purplish anâ
ghastly. âCan he kill himself that way?â I asked the Friar.

âI donât know,â sez the Friar. âI think âat when he loses
consciousness, natureâll take holt, anâ make him breathe the most
comfortable wayâbut I donât know.â

âLet Olaf take a look at his flame,â sez Horace; so Olaf looked at
Badger a long time.

Olaf hadnât wasted much of his time on Badger. He wasnât long on
forgiveness, Olaf wasnât; anâ ever since the time âat Badger had been
so enthusiastic in tryinâ to have him lynched for killinâ Bud Fisher,
Olaf had give it out as his opinion that Badger was doomed for hell,
anâ he wasnât disposed to take any hand in postponinâ his departure.
Olaf was the matter-oâ-factest feller I ever knew. Theâ donât seem to
be much harm in most of our cussinâ, but when Olaf indulged in
profanity, he was solemn anâ earnest, the same as if he was sayinâ a
prayer backwards.

âIt donât look like Badgerâs flame,â sez he after a time. âItâs
gettinâ mighty weak anâ blue, anâ theâs a thick spot over his heart
which shows plainer ân the one over his wound.â

âI move we give him a fresh start,â sez Horace.

âHeâd ort to be lynched,â sez Tank. âI donât see why we canât try him
out now, anâ if we find him guilty, why he can kill himself if he
wants to, or else get well again anâ weâll do it for him.â

Neither what Horace said nor what Tank said called out much response.
We knew theâ wasnât any one could say a good word for Badger-face anâ
so he well deserved his stretchinâ; but on the other hand, there he
was turninâ gray before our eyes, anâ it went againâ our nature to
discard him, after havinâ hung on to him for two weeks. The Friar left
the side of the bed anâ retired into a corner, leavinâ us free to
express ourselves.

âI donât see how we can let him go free,â sez Tank. âHe sez himself
âat he ort to be lynched; anâ when a feller canât speak a good word
for himself, I donât see who can.â

âBadger-face,â sez Horace, âyouâre the darnedest bother of a man I
ever saw. First you infest us until we have to shoot a hole through
you, anâ then we have to nurse you for two weeks, anâ now youâre
digginâ your heels into our consciences. I give you my word we wonât
lynch you if you get well. Weâll turn you over to the law.â

Badgerâs thin lips fell back over his yellow teeth in the ghastliest
grin a live man ever hung out. âThe law,â sez he with bitter sarcasm,
âthe law! Have you ever been in a penitentiary?â

âNo,â sez Horace, âI have not.â

âWell, I have,â sez Badger. âI was put in for another fellerâs deed;
anâ they gave me the solitary, the jacket, the bull-rings, the
water-cure, and if youâll roll me over after Iâm dead, you can still
see the scars of the whip on my back. Iâve tried the law, anâ Iâll see
you all damned before I try it again.â

Badger-face was as game as they generally get. As soon as he stopped
talkinâ he began to breathe against his heart again. Horace stood
lookinâ at him for a full minute, anâ then he lost his temper.

âYouâre a coward, thatâs what you are!â sez Horace. âI said all along
âat you were a coward, anâ another feller said so too, anâ now youâre
provinâ it. You can sneak anâ kill cows anâ cut saddles in the dark,
but you havenât the nerve to face things in the open. Now, youâre
sneakinâ off into the darkness oâ death because youâre afraid to face
the light of life.â

This was handinâ it to him purty undiluted, anâ Badger opened his eyes
anâ looked at Horace. His eyes were heavy anâ dull, but they didnât
waver any. âDinky,â sez Badger-face, âthe only thing I got againâ you
is your size. Iâve been called a lot oâ different things in my time;
but youâre the first gazabo âat ever called me a cowardâanâ youâre
about the only one who has a right to, âcause you put me out fair anâ
square. I wish you had traveled my path alongside oâ me, though. You
ainât no milksop, but after youâd been given a few oâ the deals Iâve
had, youâd take to the dark too. You can call me a coward if you want
to, or, after Iâm gone, you can think of me as just beinâ dog tired
anâ glad oâ the chance to crawl off into the dark to sleep. I donât
want to be on your conscience; thatâs not my game. All I want is just
to get shut oâ the whole blame business.â

He talked broken anâ quavery, anâ it took him a long time to finish;
but when he did quit, he turned on his bad breathinâ again. Horace had
flushed up some when Badger had mentioned milksop; but when he had
finished, Horace took his wasted hand in a hearty grip, anâ sez: âI
take it back, Badger. You ainât no coward. I only wanted to taunt you
into stickinâ for another round; but I think mighty well oâ ya. Will
you agree to cut loose from the Ty Jones crowd anâ try to be a man, if
we give you your freedom, a new outfit, and enough money to carry you
out of the country?â

It was some time before Badger spoke, anâ then he said: âNope, I canât
do it. Ty knows my record, anâ heâs treated me white; but if I quit
him, heâll get me when I least expect it. Now understand, Dinky, that
I donât hold a thing againâ you, youâre the squarest feller Iâve ever
met up with; but Iâm not cominâ back to life again. From where I am
now, I can see it purty plain, anâ it ainât worth the trouble.â

âYou could write back to Ty that you made your escape from us,â sez
Horace.

âThatâs the best idee youâve put over,â sez Badger, after heâd thought
it out; âbut I havenât enough taste for life to make the experiment.
Donât fuss about me any more. I donât suffer a mite. I feel just like
a feller in the Injun country, goinâ to sleep on post after days in
the saddle. He knows itâll mean death, but heâs too tired out to care
a white bean.â

âHave you ever been in the army?â asked the Friar from his place in
the corner. We all gave a little start at the sound of his voice, for
it came with a snap anâ unexpected.

Badgerâs lips dropped back for another hideous grin. âYes,â he said,
âIâve been in both the penitentiary and the armyâand theyâre a likely
pair.â

âDid you have a buck-skin bag?â asked the Friar, cominâ up to the bed.

Badger-face tried to raise himself on his elbow, but he couldnât quite
make it. âYes, I did,â sez he, droppinâ back again. âWhat became of
it?â

âI am keepinâ it for ya,â sez the Friar. âDo you wish to leave any
word in case you do not recover?â

âNo,â sez Badger, âtheâ ainât no one to leave word to. That letter was
from my mother, anâ that was her picture. Sheâs been dead a long
string oâ years now.â

âThere was another picture anâ a newspaper clippinâ,â sez the Friar.

Badger-face didnât give no heed; anâ after a time the Friar sez: âWhat
shall I do with them?â

âThrow âem away,â sez Badger-face. âThey donât concern me none. I was
more took with that womanâs picture ân airy other I ever saw. That was
all.â

âWhere did you get it?â asked the Friar.

âI got it from a young Dutchy,â sez Badger wearily. âHe killed a
feller over at Leadville anâ came out here anâ took on with Ty Jones.
He said she was an opery singer, anâ got drugged at a hotel where he
was workinâ.â

Badger-face was gettinâ purty weak by now, anâ he stopped with a sort
of sigh. The Friar took holt of his hand. âI am very much interested
in this woman,â he said, lookinâ into Badgerâs face as if tryinâ to
give him life enough to go on with. âCan you tell me anything else
about her?â

âNot much,â sez Badger-face. âShe was singinâ at what he called the
Winter Garden at Berlin, Germany. Some Austrian nobility got mashed on
her anâ drugged her at the hotel. Dutchy was mashed on her, too, I
reckon. They had advertised for him in a New York paper, anâ when he
got shot, over at Little Monteâs dance hall, he asked me to write
about it. His mother had died leavinâ property, anâ all they wanted
was to round up the heirs. I reckon they were glad enough to have
Dutchy scratched from the list. I donât know why I did keep that
clippinâ.â

âHave you any idee how long ago it was âat the woman was drugged?â
asked the Friar.

âI havenât any idee,â sez Badger-face weakly. âCarl was killed four
years ago this Christmas eve; so it had to be before that.â

âListen to me, Badger-face,â sez the Friar, grippinâ his hand tight.
âI want you to get well. I know that all these men will stand by you
and help you to start a new life.â

âHow long is it since Iâve been laid up?â asked Badger.

âTwo weeks,â sez the Friar. âThis is two days after Christmas.â

âWho tended to me?â asked Badger.

âWe all did,â sez the Friar, âand we all stand ready to help you make
a new start.â

âI had a good enough start,â sez Badger; âbut I fooled it away, anâ
Iâm too old now to make a new one.â

âIs there any word you want sent to your friends at Ty Jonesâs?â asked
the Friar.

Once more Badger skinned his face into the grin. âFriends?â sez he.
âWhen you trap a wolf, does he send any word to his friends? I havenât
got no friends.â

âSwallow this milk,â sez Horace holdinâ some of it out to him in a big
spoon. Kit had made Olaf start to milkinâ a cow, âcause she wanted to
use milk in cookinâ, and intended to make butter when she had the
cream saved up. Badger put the milk in his mouth, anâ then spit it out
again.

âDonât you put anything else in my mouth,â he sez. âI told you I was
goinâ to die; anâ by blank, I am goinâ to die.â

âFellers,â sez Horace, turninâ to us, âdo you think this man is goinâ
to die?â We all nodded our heads. âThen, will you give his life to me,
to do with as I will?â asked Horace; and we nodded our heads again.

Horace took off his coat, anâ rolled up his sleeves, anâ then he came
over anâ shook Badger-face by the shoulder. âListen to me,â he sez. âI
fought ya once before, for your life, and Iâm goinâ to fight you for
it now. Do you hear what I sayâIâm goinâ to fight you for your own
life. Iâm goinâ to make you swallow milk, if I have to tie you anâ
pour it in through a funnel. You canât hold your breath anâ fight, anâ
Iâm goinâ to fight you.â

Badger-face opened his eyes anâ looked up into Horaceâs face. He
looked a long time, anâ the ghost of a smile crept into his face.
âWell, youâre the doggonedest little cuss I ever saw!â he exclaimed.
He waited a long time, anâ then set his teeth. âYou beat me once,â he
muttered. âNow, see if you can beat me again.â

It was after midnight; so when Horace dropped the hint that he
wouldnât need any help except from me anâ the Friar, the rest oâ the
boys dug out for the bunk shack. Then Horace took us over to the
fireplace anâ asked us what was the best thing to do.

âI do believe âat you have stumbled on the right plan to save him,â
sez the Friar. âHe has no fever, the wound is doinâ splendid, and he
has a powerful constitution. The trouble is that he does not will to
live. We must spur on his will, and if we can make him fight back,
thisâll help. Also we must control him as much as possible through
suggestion. Have you any plan oâ your own?â

âNo,â sez Horace candidly. Horace didnât need anything for any
emergency except his own nerve. âI am determined that he must live,
but I have no plan.â

âThe first thing is to give him a little warm milk,â sez the Friar.

âAll right,â sez Horace. âYou tell me what to doâby signs, as much as
possibleâbut let me give the orders to Badger-face. My size has made
an impression on him, and we canât afford to lose a single trick.â The
Friar agreed to this anâ we went back to the bunk.

âBadger-face,â sez Horace, âIâd rather give you this milk peaceful;
but Iâm goinâ to give it to ya, anâ you can bet what ya like on that.â

Badger opened his eyes again, anâ they were dull anâ glazy. âThis
reminds me oâ the water-cure at the pen,â he said, anâ then set his
teeth.

âHold his hands, Happy,â sez Horace, as full oâ fight as a snow-plow.
âHold his head, Friar. Now then, swallow or drown.â

It looked purty inhuman, but Badger had to swallow after a bit, anâ
when we had put as much milk into him as we wantedâonly a couple oâ
spoonfulsâwe let him go, anâ he fell asleep, pantinâ a little. We
woke him up in half an hour, anâ put some more milk into him. When he
slept, his breathinâ was more like natural, anâ the fourth time, I
didnât have to hold his hands; so I went to sleep myself.

Well, Horace won this fight, too. In about four days, Badger-face
began to have an appetite, anâ then it was all off with him. He
couldnât have died if weâd left him plumb alone; but he hadnât give up
yet. The Friar kept him down to a mighty infan-tile diet, sayinâ that
a lung shot was a bad one, anâ the pure mountain air was all that had
saved him; but even now fever was likely to come back on him.

It was close to the tenth oâ January when Horace came in from a ride
one eveninâ, anâ went in to see Badger-face, still wearinâ his gun.
Quick as a wink, Badger grabbed the gun; but Horace threw himself on
Badgerâs arm, anâ yelled for help. The Friar anâ Olaf rushed in from
the lean-to, anâ corraled the gun in short order.

âYou blame little bob-cat, you!â sez Badger. âI didnât intend to use
the gun on you.â

âI know what you intended to do,â sez Horace; âbut you donât win this
deal as easy as all that.â




CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

A STRANGE ALLIANCE


After this we tied Badger-face in bed anâ kept watch of him. He kept
on gettinâ stronger all the time, anâ a good percent of his meanness
came back with his strength. Sometimes heâd spend hours tauntinâ
Horace anâ the Friar; but they didnât mind it any more ân if Badger
had been a caged beast. Then one night he concluded to try cussinâ. He
started in to devise somethinâ extra fancy in the way oâ high-colored
profanity; but he hadnât gone very far on this path, before Olaf came
in as black as a thunder cloud.

âDo you want to be whipped with a whip?â he demanded.

âNaw, I donât want to be whipped with a whip,â sez Badger-face.

âThen you stop swearinâ,â sez Olaf. âWe been to enough trouble about
you, and I donât intend to have my wife listen to any more oâ your
swearinâ. If you donât stop it, I whip all your skin off. You say you
want to dieâI whip you to death before your very eyes.â

Badger heaved at his ropes a time or two, anâ then he realized his
weakness, sank back on the bed, anâ the tears rolled down his cheeks.
He fair sobbed. âYouâre a set oâ cowards,â he yelled, âthe whole pack
oâ you! You wouldnât let me die, and now you threaten to whip me to
death. I dare any one of ya to shoot meâyou yellow-hearted cowards!â

âI care not for what you say I am,â said Olaf. âYou know if I am a
coward, and you know if I keep my word. I say to you, slow anâ
careful, that if you yell swear words again in my house, I whip your
hide off.â

Well, this had a quietinâ influence on Badgerâs conversation; but he
fretted himself a good deal as to what we intended to do with him.
Finally one day when he began to look a little more like a live man
than a skeleton, Horace sez to him: âBadger, you said you didnât have
any friends, anâ it must be true, âcause not one of your own outfit
has ever been to see you, not even Ty Jones.â

âTy Jones donât stay out here through the winter,â sez Badger-face.
âIf heâd been here, heâd have squared things up for this, one way or
another.â

âWhere does he go?â asked Horace.

âI donât know,â sez Badger-face.

Horace asked Olaf about it, and Olaf said âat Ty Jones allus pulled
out in December, anâ didnât come back until March.

Then Horace came in and sat by Badger again. âIâve got a proposition
to make to you,â sez he, âand you think it over before you answer. I
have plenty oâ money; but Iâve wasted most oâ my life, sittinâ down.
If you are sick of livinâ like a wolf, Iâll pay your expenses and half
again as much as Ty Jones is payinâ you, and all youâll have to agree
to is to go along as a sort of handy-man for me. I think we can get to
be purty good friends, but that can wait. I intend to ramble around
wherever my notions take me. If youâll give your word to be as decent
as you can, Iâll give my word to stand by you as far as Iâm able. Your
life is forfeit to me, anâ if youâll do your part, I intend to make
the balance of it worth while to ya. Now, donât answer me; but think
it over anâ ask all the questions you want to. Iâll answer true what I
do answer; but I wonât answer any âat I donât want to.â

If Horace had crept in anâ cut off his two ears, Badger wouldnât have
been any more surprised. Well, none of us would, as far as that goes;
though why we should let anything âat Horace chose to do surprise us
by this time is more ân I know.

He anâ Badger talked it over complete for several days, Horace
agreeinâ that he wouldnât ask Badger to go anywhere the army or the
law was likely to get him anâ not to make him do any stunts âat would
make him look foolish. He told Horace âat he had served one enlistment
anâ got a top-notch discharge, anâ had then took on again; but a
drunken officer had him tied on a spare artillery wheel because Badger
had laughed when the officer had fallen off his horse into a mud
puddle. He said they had laid the wheel on the ground and him across
it, the small of his back restinâ on the hub oâ the wheel, anâ his
arms anâ legs spread anâ tied to the rim, anâ had kept him there ten
hours. He said that he had deserted the first chance he got; but he
refused to tell what had happened to the officer afterward.

Finally Badger said he would take up Horaceâs proposition; anâ Horace
called Olaf in to see if Badger was speakinâ true. This was the first
Badger had ever heard about Olafâs eyes seeinâ soul-flames; but he
said âat this explained a lot to him he hadnât understood before. Olaf
looked at him careful; anâ Badger held up his right hand anâ said that
as long as Horace treated him square, he would be square with Horace,
even to the point of givinâ up his life for him.

âHe is speakinâ true,â sez Olaf; and from that very minute,
Badger-face became a different man, anâ Horace took off the ropes.

âYou do look some like a badger with that bum beard on,â sez Horace;
âbut I donât like this name, and I want you to pick out a new one.
Pick out some Christian name, your own or any other; but now that you
are startinâ on a new life, it will help to have a new name.â

Badger-face studied over this a long time, but he couldnât root up any
name to suit him so he told Horace to pick out a name, and heâd agree
to wear it.

âWell,â sez Horace, after heâd give it a good thinkinâ over, âI think
Iâll call you Promotheus.â

Badger looked at him purty skeptical. âI donât intend to take no
Greaser name,â sez he. âIs that Mexican?â

âNo,â sez Horace. âThatâs Greek; anâ the original Promotheus was an
all around top-notcher. He was a giant, so you couldnât complain none
on your size; he rebelled againâ the powers, so you couldnât call him
a dog-robber; but the thing âat you two are closest together in, is
your infernal stubbornness. They tried to break Promotheus down by
chaininâ him to a rock while the vultures fed on his liver, but they
couldnât make him give in. âPity the slaves who take the yoke,â sez
he; âbut donât pity me who still have my own self-respect.ââ

Badger-face was so blame weak that his eyes filled up with tears at
this; anâ the only way he could straighten himself up was to put a few
florid curses on his own thumby left-handedness; but Olaf had gone
after some wood, so it didnât start anything. âIâll take that name,â
sez he, âanâ Iâll learn how to spell anâ pronounce it as soon as I
can; but youâve diluted down my blood so confounded thin with your
doggone, sloppy milk diet that Iâm a long way from havinâ that
fellerâs grit, right at this minute.â

Horace stood over Badger-face, anâ pointed his finger at him, fierce.
âListen to me,â sez he. âThe next time you heave out an insult to
milksops or milk diets, Iâll sing you my entire songâto the very last
word.â

We set up a howl; but Badger-face didnât realize all he was up against
when he took on with Horace, so he only smiled in a sickly way, anâ
looked puzzled.

âIâll tell ya what Iâm willinâ to do, Dinky,â said he, as soon as we
stopped our noise; ânow that Iâve took a new name, I donât need to
wear this sort of a beard any more, anâ, if ya want me to, Iâll trim
it up the same fool way âat you wear yours; anâ Iâll wear glasses,
too, if you say the word.â

âWeâll wait first to see how you look in a biled shirt,â sez Horace;
âbut in honor of your new name, Iâm goinâ to let you have some
deer-meat soup for your dinner, anâ a bone to gnaw on.â

We had a regular feast that day, and called Badger-face Promotheus
every time we could think up an excuse; so as to have practice on the
name. The Friar did his best to take part; but I knew every line in
his face, and it hurt me to see him fightinâ at himself.

After dinner we took a walk together; but we didnât talk none until we
had climbed the rim, fought the wind for a couple of hours, anâ
started back again. It was his plan to think of some big, common chunk
of life when he was in trouble, so as to take his mind as much as
possible off himself; and he started to talk about Horace anâ
Promotheus. He even laughed a little at the combination which
Promotheus Flannigan anâ Horace Walpole Bradford would make when they
settled down on the East again.

âThe more I think it over,â said the Friar, âthe plainer I can see
that most of our sorrow anâ pain and savageness comes from our custom
of punishinâ the crops instead of the farmers. Look at the
possibilities theâ was in Promotheus when he started out. He has a
strong nature, and in spite of his life, he still has a lot oâ decent
humanity in him. Who can tell what he might have been, if his good
qualities had been cultivated instead oâ smothered?â

âThatâs true enough,â sez I; âand look at Horace, too. They simply let
him wither up for forty years, and yet all this time he had in him
full as much devilment as Promotheus himself.â

âOh, we waste, we waste, we waste!â exclaimed the Friar. âInstead oâ
usinâ the strength and vigor of our manhood in a noble way, we let
some of it rust and decay, and some of it we use for our own
destruction. The outlaw would have been the hero with the same
opportunity, and who can tell what powers lie hidden behind the mask
of idleness!â

âWell, thatâs just it,â sez I. âA human beinâ is like a keg oâ black
stuff. For years it may sit around perfectly harmless; and only when
the right spark pops into it can we tell whether itâs black sand or
blastinâ powder. Even Horace, himself, thought he was black sand; but
he turned out to be a mighty high grade oâ powder.â

We walked on a while without talkinâ; but the Friar was wrastlinâ with
his own thoughts, anâ finally he stopped anâ asked me as solemn as
though I was the boss oâ that whole country: âIf you had started a lot
oâ work, and part of it promised to yield a rich harvest with the
right care, and part of it looked as though it might sink back to
worse than it had been in the beginninââis there anything in the
world which could make you give it up?â

The Friar knew my life as well as I did; so I didnât have to do any
pertendinâ with him. âYes,â I sez, âthe right woman would.â

The Friar didnât do any pertendinâ with me either. He stood, shakinâ
his head slowly from side to side. âI wish I knew, I wish I knew,â he
said.

We walked on again, anâ when we came in sight oâ the cabin, I sez to
him, in order to give him a chance to free his mind if he saw fit:
âHorace told me what he knew about it.â

âYes, I know,â sez the Friar; âbut no one knew very much. She was a
splendid brave girl, Happy. I had known her when she was a little girl
and I a farmer boy. I was much older than she was, but I was allus
interested in her. There wasnât one thing they could say against
herâand yet they drove her out oâ my life. I thought she was dead, I
heard that she was dead; so I buried her in my heart, and came out
here where life was strong and young, because I could not work back
there. I tried to work in the slums of the cities; but I could not
conquer my own bitterness, with the rich wastinâ and the poor starvinâ
all about me. I have found joy in my life out here; but she has come
to life again with that picture, and once more I am at war with
myself.â

âWell, Iâll bet my eyes, Friar,â sez I, âthat you find the right
answer; but I havenât got nerve enough to advise yaâthough I will say
that if it was me, Iâd pike out anâ look for the girl.â

âI wish I knew, I wish I knew,â was all the Friar said.

Promotheus didnât have any set-backs after this. We talked over
whether it would be better to have him go up to Tyâs anâ tell the boys
some big tale about Dinky Bradford, or to just pull out anâ leave âem
guessinâ; and we finally came to the conclusion âat the last would be
the best.

He was still purty weak by the first oâ February; but he was beginninâ
to fret at beinâ housed up any longer, so we began to get ready to hit
the back-trail. By takinâ wide circles we could get through all right,
at this season; but with Promotheus still purty wobbly, it wasnât
likely to be a pleasant trip, anâ we didnât hurry none with our
preparations. Horace insisted on payinâ Olaf two hundred dollars for
his share oâ the bother, anâ Iâm purty certain he slipped Kit another
hundred. He wasnât no wise scrimpy with money.

We started on the tenth of February, Promotheus ridinâ a quiet old
hoss, anâ still lookinâ purty much like a bitter recollection. They
were considâable surprised when we arrived at the Diamond Dot; but we
only told âem as much of our huntinâ as we felt was necessary.

Horace intended to start for the East at once; but next day when he
put on his dude clothes again, Promotheus purty nigh bucked on him.
Most of Horaceâs raiment was summer stuff, nachely; but he had a long
checked coat âat he wore with a double ended cap, which certainly did
look comical. He had cut some fat off his middle, anâ had pushed out
his chest anâ shoulders considâable; so that his stuff wrinkled on
him; and it took a full hour to harden Promotheus to the change.

âDo I have to look like that?â sez he.

âYou conceited ape you!â sez Horace. âYou couldnât look like this if
you went to a beauty doctor for the rest oâ time; but as soon as we
get where they sell clothes for humans, Iâm goinâ to provide you with
somethinâ in the nature of a disguise.â

Disguise sounded mighty soothinâ to Promotheus, so he gritted his
teeth, anâ said he wouldnât go back on his word. The fact was, that it
did give ya an awful shock to see Horace as he formerly was. We had
got so used to seeinâ him gettinâ about, able anâ free, that it almost
seemed like a funeral to have him drop down to those clothes again.

The Friar went over to the station with us, and he anâ Horace had a
confidential talk; and then Horace and Promotheus got on the train and
scampered off East.

âIâm goinâ to stick right here, Happy,â sez the Friar. âI have let my
work get way behind, in tendinâ to Promotheus; but from now on Iâm
goinâ to tie into it again. Iâd like to do something to put the cattle
men and the sheep men on better terms; but this seems like a hard
problem.â

âYes,â sez I, âthat ainât no job for a preacher, and Iâd advise you to
let it alone. The cattle men will put up the same sort of an argument
for their range âat the Injuns did; but between you and me, I doubt if
they stand much more show in the long run.â

âI canât see why there isnât room for both,â sez the Friar. âIt seems
to me that the cattle men are too harsh.â

âNope,â sez I, âthere ainât room for âem both, anâ theâs somethinâ
irritatinâ about sheep that makes ya want to be harsh with all who
have dealinâs with âem. Hosses can starve out cattle anâ sheep can
starve out hosses; but after a sheep has grazed over a place, nothinâ
bigger ân an ant can find any forage left. Cattle are wild anâ
tempestus, anâ they bellow anâ tear around anâ fight, and the men who
tend âem are a good bit like âem; while sheep just meekly take
whatever youâve a mind to give âem; but they hang on, just the same,
anâ multiply a heap faster ân cattle do. A sheep man is meekâlike a
Jew. If a Jew gets what he wants heâs satisfied, anâ heâs willinâ to
pertend âat heâs had the worst oâ the deal; but a cattle man is never
satisfied unless he has grabbed what he wanted away from some one
else, anâ then shot him up a little for kickinâ about it. Itâll
probably be fifty or a hundred years yet, before the sheep men are
strong enough to worry the cattle men; but theyâll sure do it some
day.â Thatâs what I told the Friar that time at the station, anâ I
guessed the outcome close enough, though I didnât make much of a hit
as to the time it was goinâ to take.

Well, the Friar, he rode away east to Laramie, and I went north to the
Diamond Dot, and got things ready for the summer work.




CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

THE HEART OF HAPPY HAWKINS


Late the next summer, I got a fine long letter from Horaceâand blame
if he didnât succeed in surprisinâ me again. He wrote this letter from
Africa, which is about the foreignest parts this world is able to
exhibit, I reckon. He told about the East not findinâ favor with
Promotheus, though he had done all he could for him, startinâ out with
high society and endinâ up by takinâ him down one night to a sailorâs
saloon and lettinâ him mix into a general fight; but that Promotheus
just simply couldnât stand the tameness, and so they had gone to
Africa to hunt big game, and give the folks out our way a chance to
forget there ever had been such a cuss as Badger-face.

He sent along some photographs, too, and they was as novel as a blue
moonâHorace, Promotheus, and a lot oâ naked niggers totinâ packs on
their heads. Horace was the funniest lookinâ mortal a body ever saw;
but Promotheus had him beat a mile. They both wore bowls on their
heads anâ colored glasses; but Promotheus with side-burns was sure
enough to frighten a snake into convulsions! His gnawinâ teeth stuck
out through a self-satisfied grin; and I was willinâ to bet that as
soon as the heathen saw him, theyâd give up bowinâ down to wood anâ
stone.

The next time I saw Friar Tuck, he told me about receivinâ a letter
from Horace who had gone to Berlin on his way to Africa, but hadnât
been able to learn anything satisfactory. The singer had been the big
card at their concerts, anâ there had been some talk about her gettinâ
drugged by an Austrian who belonged to the em-bassy; but she had
disappeared complete, anâ nobody could be found who seemed to know
anything about it. The Friar kept himself goinâ like a steam-engine
these days; but while he became a little more tender if possible, he
lacked something of his old-time spirits. Before this, he used to come
sweepinâ along like a big cool breeze, anâ a fellerâs spirits just got
up anâ whirled along with him, like dry leaves dancinâ in the wind.

He said âat since Promotheus had slipped out oâ the country, the
Cross-branders hadnât bothered Olaf any; but I called his attention to
the fact that this was a wet spring, anâ told him âat when we had a
long dry spell, Ty Jones would just swallow Olaf like quicksand.

Things drifted along purty steady in our parts for several years. Once
in a while, the Friar would tell me something about Olaf or something
about Ty Jones; but for the most part, I was too much took up with
other things to care much for even the Friarâs doinâs.

I was takinâ my own Moses-trip durinâ these years; and I say now, as I
allus have said, that it wasnât a square shake to show Moses the
promised land, anâ then not let him into it for even one meal oâ milk
anâ honey. Iâve handled a small bunch oâ men anâ trailed cattle with
âem for only three months at a stretch; but I donât mind tellinâ you
that theâ was times when I had to sit up till after midnight, sewinâ
up the rips in my patienceâanâ we didnât have any women anâ children
along either. Moses had forty years of it in the desert; with a whole
blame tribe of Israelites; and yet, instead oâ praisinâ him for
hanginâ on to his sanity with all the odds againâ him, he was handed a
tantalizer, simply because he said he couldnât see why somethinâ
didnât happen in a natural, orderly way, once in a while, without
everlastingly ringinâ in some new kind of a miracle on him.

If I had to pilot a mob like that through a desert for forty years,
follerinâ a cloud by day anâ a pillar oâ fire by night, havinâ dressed
quail anâ breakfast-food tossed to me out oâ the sky, gettinâ my
drinkinâ water by knockinâ it out of a rock, anâ tryinâ to satisfy the
tourists that it wasnât altogether my fault that we traveled so
everlastinâ slowâIâd âaâ been mad enough to bite all the enamel off
my teeth, and yet as far as I could see, Moses didnât do a single
thing but show out a little peevish once in a while.

Still, we didnât choose our natures nor the kind oâ life to range âem
over nor the sorts oâ temptations weâd prefer to wrastle with; anâ
even our own experiences are more ân we can understandâto say nothinâ
oâ settinâ back anâ decidinâ upon the deeds of others. My own test
wasnât the one Iâd âaâ chosen; and yet, for all I know, it may âaâ
been the very best one, for me.

Little Barbie had finally grown up through childhood to the gates oâ
womanhoodâand as generally happens, she had found a man waitinâ for
her there. Through all the years of her growinâ, she had been sendinâ
out tendrils which reached over anâ wound about my heart, and grew
into it anâ through it, and became part of it. If it hadnât âaâ been
for Friar Tuck, I might âaâ married her, myself; for I could have done
it, if all the men Iâd had to fight had been other menâbut the man I
couldnât overcome, was myself.

Through all the years I had known Friar Tuck anâ rode with him anâ
worked with him anâ slept out under the stars with him, he had been
quietly traininâ me for the time when it would be my call to take my
own love by the throat, for the sake of the woman I loved. It donât
weaken a man to do this; but it tears himâMy God, how it does tear
him!

I, my own self, brought back the man she loved to her, and gave her
into his arms; and Iâve never regretted it for one single minute; but
I doubt if Iâve ever forgot it for much longer ân this either.

I did what it seemed to me I had to doâanâ the Friar thinks I did
right, which counts a whole lot more with me ân what others think. I
went through my desert, I climbed my hill, for just one moment I saw
into my promised landâand then I was jerked back, and not even given
promotion into the next world, which Moses drew as his consolation
prize. And yet, takinâ it all around, I can see where life has been
mighty kind and generous to me after all, and Iâm not kickinâ for a
minute.

The great break in my life came in the fall, and it left olâ Cast
Steel a more changed man ân it did me. I wanted to swing out wideâto
ride and ride and ride until I forgot who I was and what had happened;
but the olâ man worked on my pity, anâ I agreed to stay on with him a
spell. Durinâ the three years precedinâ, I had got into the handlinâ
of the ranch, more ân he had, himself; so I spent the winter makinâ my
plans, anâ goinâ over âem with him. He came out toward spring and was
more like himself; but when the first flowers blossomed on the
benches, they seemed to be drawinâ their life blood out oâ my very
heart. All day long I had a burninâ in my eyes, everywhere I went I
missed somethinâ, until the empty hole in my breast seemed likely to
drive me frantic; anâ one day I pertended to be mad about some little
thing, anâ threw up my job for good and all.

The olâ man was as decent as they ever get. He knew how I had been
hit, anâ he didnât try any foolishness. He gave me what money I
wanted, told me to go and have it out with myself, anâ come back to
him as soon as I could. I rode away without havinâ any aim or end in
view, just rode anâ rode anâ rode with memories crowdinâ about me so
thick, I couldnât see the trail I was goinâ.

Then one night I drew up along side oâ Friar Tuckâs fire, saw the
steady light of his courage blazinâ out through his own sadness, the
same as it had done all those years; anâ I flopped myself off my hoss,
threw myself flat on the grass, anâ only God and the Friar know how
many hours I lay there with his hand restinâ light on my shoulder, the
little fire humminâ curious, soothinâ words oâ comfort, and up above,
the same olâ stars shininâ down clear and unchanginâ to point out,
that no matter how the storms rage about the surface oâ the earth,
itâs allus calm and right, if a feller only gets high enough.




CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

THE LITTLE TOWN OF BOSCO


I hadnât done much eatinâ or sleepinâ on that trip, anâ I was plumb
beat out; so after I fell asleep, the Friar put a soogan over me and
left me by the fire. He awakened me next morninâ, gettinâ breakfast,
and it didnât take him very long to talk me into joininâ on to him for
company. I had been avoidinâ humans, for fear I might be tempted to
start trouble and find the easy way out of it all; but his plan was
just the oppositeâto dive so deep into humanity that I could catch a
glimpse oâ the scheme oâ things.

The Friar held that we all had crosses cominâ to us any way. If we
picked âem up anâ put âem on our own shoulders, weâd still be free,
anâ the totinâ of our crosses would make us stronger; while if we
tried to run away, weâd be roped anâ thrown, anâ the crosses chained
on us. Iâd a heap sooner be free than a slave; so I decided to carry
mine, head up, anâ get right with myself as soon as possible.

The Friar didnât work off any solemn stuff on me, nor he didnât try to
be funny; he just turned himself into a sun-glass, anâ focused enough
sunshine on to me to warm me up without any risk of blisterinâ. I got
to know him even better those days than I had before. His hair was
gettinâ a bit frosty at the temples; but aside from this, he hadnât
aged none since the first day I had seen him. He was like some big
tree growinâ all by itself. Every year it seems a little ruggeder,
every year it seems to offer a little roomier shade; but the wind and
the rain and the hot sun donât seem to make it grow old. They only
seem to make it take a deeper root, and throw out a wider spread oâ
boughs.

He told me oâ some oâ the scraps between the cattle men anâ the sheep
menâthe Diamond Dot was out oâ the way of sheep at that time. Then I
began to take a little more interest in things, anâ after takinâ note
for a day or so, I prophesied a dry summer; and this brought us around
to Olaf.

The Friar warmed up at mention of him. He said âat he had never seen a
match turn out better ân Olafâs. He said Kit had just what Olaf
lacked, anâ Olaf had just what Kit lacked, anâ their boy was just
about the finest kid he knew of anywhere. We decided to head up their
way anâ pay a visit.

As we rode along we took notice of the way things were changinâ. We
passed several sheep wagons, five or six irrigation ditches, anâ here
and there, we found men who put more faith in alfalfa ân they did in
stock. The Friar had been well to the north when I happened upon him,
and we traveled a sight oâ country before we reached our destination.
Everywhere folks knew him, anâ he knew them; and when I saw their
faces light up at sight of him, I had to admit that he had done the
right thing in stickinâ.

Mostly he sang the âArt thou weary,â one for his marchinâ song, now;
and it got into my blood and did a lot to healthen me up again. I
canât rightly say âat I ever got religion; but more ân once religion
has got me anâ lifted me up like the Crazy Water in flood, bearinâ me
on over rocks anâ through whirlpools, anâ showinâ me what a weak,
useless thing I was at the best. Theâs somethinâ inside me âat allus
responded to the Friarâs music, anâ made me willinâ to sweep on over
the edge oâ the world with him; but when he tried to reason out
religion to me, I have to own up âat theâ was a lot of it I couldnât
see into.

We passed Skeltyâs old place on our way in, anâ found a red-eyed,
black-headed man runninâ it. His name was Maxwell, but they still
called the place Skeltyâs. We went in anâ had dinner, anâ found five
or six Cross-branders there. They were doinâ plenty oâ drinkinâ anâ
crackinâ idiotic jokes with the girls; but they nodded friendly enough
to us, anâ we nodded back.

As soon as we finished, the Friar went outside for his smoke; but I
leaned back right where I was for mine. One oâ the Cross-branders, a
tall, gaunt, squinty cuss by the name oâ Dixon, was sittinâ near me,
and presently he turned anâ sez: âYouâre Happy Hawkins, ainât ya?â

âThatâs me,â sez I.

âWell, on the level,â sez he, âwhat became oâ Badger-face?â

âIâve often wondered about that myself,â sez I.

âWe supposed he got killed,â sez he; âbut two fellers claimed they saw
him goinâ south in the spring with your huntinâ party.â

âWhat made ya think he got killed?â sez I.

ââCause he started over here one night, and never showed up again,â
sez he.

âI donât know what become of him,â sez I. âDinky Bradford said he was
goinâ to take him to Africa; but whether he did or not I canât say. I
never felt no call to pry into Dinkyâs business. Looks to me as though
we were goinâ to have an extra dry summer.â

âI say so too,â sez Dixon. âWho was this Dinky Bradford?â

âThatâs bothered me a heap,â sez I. âHe claimed to be a Greek hero,
though what sort oâ business that is, I canât say. Finished your
round-up yet?â

âJust got through. Where is this Greek hero these days?â sez he.

âCanât prove it by me,â sez I. âHeâs one oâ these fellers no one seems
to know anything about. I saw him go without eatinâ for four days
once, anâ he came out of it in better shape ân he went in. Badger-face
was your foreman, wasnât he?â

âYes,â sez he. âOlâ Pepper Kendal is foreman now.â

âI should think a foreman would have some load on his shoulders with
the boss gone all winter,â sez I.

âThe boss brought a woman back with him this time,â sez Dixon.

âWhat!â sez I. âYou donât mean ta tell me âat Ty Jones has got him a
woman after all these years?â

âThatâs what,â sez Dixon. âSomethinâ queer about her, too. Ty has had
a new shack built for her up back oâ the old house. They donât seem
overly friendly for a bride anâ groom.â

âAinât nothinâ overly friendly with Ty, is theâ?â sez I.

âOh, I dunno,â sez he. âTy ainât as sticky as taffy, but heâs a mighty
good man to work for.â

âWhat sort of a woman did he get?â sez I.

âShe donât show herself much,â sez he. âSheâs tall anâ shapely, anâ
right smart younger ân Ty; but she spends most of her time in the new
shack; and from all we can tell, sheâs froze up tighter ân Ty is.â

âWell, I guess weâll have to jog on. Good luck,â sez I, and me anâ the
Friar rode on. He was as much beat out over Ty Jones gettinâ a woman
as I was; but first thing he thought of was, âat this might have a
softeninâ effect on Ty, anâ give him an openinâ.

We reached Olafâs in time for supper, and found Kit bustlinâ about as
happy as a little brown hen. The Friar hadnât sprung it none about the
kid. He was a solid little chunk with a couple oâ dimples and all the
signs oâ health. I looked careful into his eyes. They were full oâ
devilment, anâ he scowled his brows down over âem when I held him; but
they were brown like Kitâs.

âOh, heâs too dirty to touch,â sez Kit, beaminâ all over with pride.
âI just canât keep him clean, try as I will.â

âBe careful, Happy, and donât soil your hands on that baby!â yells the
Friar as though in a panic. âLet me have him. I was dirty once,
myself.â

It was plain to see âat the kid anâ the Friar were old cronies; and it
was a pleasant sight to see âem together. The Friar got down on the
floor with him anâ played bear anâ horse anâ the kid entered into it
anâ fair howled with merriment. Kit scolded âem both anâ took so much
interest in their antics she hardly knew what she was doinâ to the
supper things.

Before long Olaf came in. He still took up all the space not otherwise
occupied; but he had an altogether-satisfied expression which made ya
forget how everlastinâ ugly he really was. He took us out anâ showed
us the garden, anâ the new wire fencinâ anâ the babyâs swing, anâ all
the rest of his treasures. Olaf didnât want any more changes to take
place in the world. If his vote could have made it, things would just
continue as they were until the earth wore out. It made me feel a
little lonely for a moment; but I entered in as hearty as I could.

Durinâ supper I sez to Kit: âWell, Ty Jones has a woman, now; and if
it improves him as much as it has Olaf, he may blossom out into a good
neighbor to you yet.â

âTy Jones got a woman!â exclaimed Kit. âWell, Iâd just like to lay my
eyes on the woman âat would take Ty Jones.â

âOh, all women ainât so set on havinâ a handsome man as you were,â sez
I.

âWell, I wouldnât have any other kind,â sez Kit, anâ she gave her head
a toss while Olaf grinned like a full moon.

They were both purty well beat out to think oâ Ty Jones havinâ a
woman, anâ we all talked it over durinâ the rest oâ the meal. After
supper, Olaf took the kid on his lap and sat by the fire tellinâ us
his plans, while Kit cleared up the dishes anâ stuck in a word of her
own now and again. It was plain to see âat she did full as much oâ the
planninâ as he did, anâ this was probably what made her so satisfied.
The kid regarded Olafâs mustache as some sort of an exercisinâ
machine, anâ Olaf had to fight him all the time he was talkinâ, but he
certainly did set a heap oâ store by that boy.

He told us he had about sixty cows and a fair run oâ two anâ three
year olds with a high average of calves; but that he intended to sell
the whole run to the Double V outfit up on the Rawhide, and get a
small band of sheep. This flattened me out complete; but he had a lot
of arguments on his side. He was also experimentinâ with grain seed
which he had got from Canada, anâ he already had a patch of alfalfa
which was doinâ fine. He was one oâ those fellers who canât tire
âemselves out, anâ so just keep on workinâ as long as the law allows
âem to use daylight. He had a young Swede workinâ for him, but just at
that time, he was off lookinâ for the work hosses which had voted
âemselves a vacation, anâ had gone up into the hills.

The Friar wanted to go up into the Basin country next day, so we
bedded down purty early. I lay awake a long time thinkinâ over what a
fright Olaf had once been, and how he had straightened out of it.

Next morninâ we started soon after sun-up. The Friar had a couple oâ
women runninâ a Sunday School at Bosco, and he wanted to see how they
were gettinâ along. They had belonged to his brand of church clear
back in England, and he set a lot of store by âem; but owned up that
they had their work cut out for âem at Bosco; it beinâ one oâ the most
ungodly little towns in the whole country.

We nooned on Carter, slipped over Boulder Creek Pass, and reached
Bosco at sun-down. It allus surprised me to see how much travel the
Friar could chalk up, takinâ his weight into account; but he was less
irritatinâ to a hoss ân airy other man I ever met up with. The more of
a hurry he was in, the more time he took on the bad hills; and he
never robbed a hoss by sleepinâ an hour late in the morninâ, anâ
makinâ the hoss even up by travelinâ beyond his gait.

The husband of one oâ these women ran a saloon, the husband of the
otherâthe women were sistersâwas the undertaker and also ran a meat
market. I thought this about the queerest business arrangement I had
ever been confronted against; but the man himself was full as peculiar
as his business.

I have a game I have played with myself all my life. I call it âwhy,â
anâ I suppose it has furnished me more fun ân anything else has. I
take any proposition I come across anâ say all the whys about it I can
think up anâ then try to answer âem. Why did anything ever happen just
as it did happen just when it did happen? This is the joke oâ life to
me. I have played it on myself times without end; but only once in a
while even with myself can I follow the line back to common sense.




CHAPTER THIRTY

TY JONES GETS A WOMAN


Bosco was a regular town with twenty or thirty houses, a post office,
two general stores, three saloons, anâ all such things; and right on a
good stage road runninâ north anâ south. We stopped with the
meat-market undertaker, âcause they didnât think it quite respectable
for the Friar to live off the profits of the liquor traffic; though
the Friar allus said âat he had a heap more respect for a square
saloon-keeper ân for a sneaky drygoods merchant.

Shindy Smith was the saloon-keeper, anâ Bill Duff was the undertaker.
Duff was the absent-mindedest man I ever got intimate with, anâ about
drove his wife to distraction, she beinâ one oâ these hustlers who
never make a false move. He had the idee that beinâ an undertaker took
away his license to laugh, so he allus walked on his toes anâ
disported as solemn a face as nature would allow; but nature had
intended him for a butcher, anâ had made his face round and jowly.
Whenever he didnât have anything else to do, he used to sit down anâ
practice lookinâ solemn. Heâd fix his eyes on the ceilinâ, clasp his
hands across his stomach, pull up his eyebrows, droop his mouth, anâ
look for all the world like a man dyinâ oâ the colic.

He was so absent-minded that heâd raise his cup to take a drink of
coffee, forget what he had started to do, anâ like as not pour it over
his flapjacks for syrup. He started to engineer a funeral once with
his butcherâs apron on, and they told all sorts of stories about him
which was shockinâ to an extent; though his wife kept such a sharp eye
on him, that I donât believe more ân half of âem. Still it wasnât any
sort oâ business for an absent-minded man to be in.

It was an uncertain business. Of course all lines oâ trade in a thinly
settled country go by fits anâ starts; but his was worst of all.
Sometimes heâd have as many as three funerals a month, and at others
it would take him six weeks to sell out a beef carcass. A feller who
had a spite againâ him started the story âat he soaked his meat in
embalminâ fluid, anâ then if they came an extra special rush in both
lines of his business at the same time, heâdâbut then his wife kept
such a skeptical eye on him, âat I donât believe a word of these
stories, anâ Iâm not goinâ to repeat âem. The worst I had againâ him
was that he was so everlastinâ careless. I lay awake frettinâ about
his carelessness till I couldnât stand it a second longer; and then I
rolled up half the beddinâ anâ started to sleep on the side porch.

âWhere you goinâ?â sez the Friar.

âThis here Bill Duff is too absent-minded anâ forgetful for me,â sez
I.

âWhat do ya mean?â sez the Friar.

âWell,â sez I, âI donât want to make light oâ sacred things, nor
nothinâ like that; but Bill Duffâs got somethinâ stored up in this
room which should âaâ been a funeral three weeks ago, and I intend to
sleep outside.â

The Friar chuckled to himself until he shook the whole house; but it
wasnât no joke to me; so I shunted the beddinâ out on the roof oâ the
porch, which was flat, and prepared to take my rest where the air was
thin enough to flow into my nostrils without scrapinâ the lid off oâ
what Horace called his olâ factory nerve.

As soon as the Friar could recover his breath, he staggered to the
window, anâ sez: âThatâs nothinâ but cheese, you blame tenderfoot.
Limburger cheese is the food Bill Duff is fondest of, and he has four
boxes of it stored in this room.â

âThen,â sez I, cominâ in with the beddinâ, âIâll sleep in the bed, anâ
the cheese can sleep on the porch; but hanged if Iâll occupy the same
apartment with it.â I set the cheese out on the porchâit was the
ripest cheese in the world, I reckonâand it drew all the dogs in town
before morninâ. After they found it was above their reach, Iâm
convinced they put up the best fight I ever listened to.

It took a long time for the memory oâ that cheese to find its way out
the window; and I lay thinkinâ oâ the Friarâs work, long after he had
drifted off himself. He wasnât squeamish about small things, the Friar
wasnât, and this was one of his main holts. When we had got ready to
eat that night, Mrs. Duff had tipped Bill a wink to ask the Friar to
say blessinâ. Bill was in one of his vacant spells, as usual, so he
looked solemn at the Friar, and sez: âItâs your deal, Parson.â Now, a
lot oâ preachers would âaâ gone blue anâ sour at that; but the Friar
never blinked a winker.

Then after supper, all the young folks oâ that locality had swooped in
to play with him. This winninâ oâ young folks was a gift with the
Friar, and it used to warm me up to watch him in the midst of a flock
of âem. He showed âem all kinds oâ tricks with matches anâ arithmetic
numbers, anâ taught âem some new games, and then he put up a joke on
âem. He allus put up one joke on âem each visit.

This time he puts a glass of water under his hat, looks solemn, and
sez âat he can drink the water without raisinâ the hat. They all bet
he canât, and finally he goes into a corner, makes motions with his
throat, and sez he is now ready to prove it. Half a dozen rush forward
and lift the hat, and he drinks the water, and thanks âem for liftinâ
the hat for him so he could drink the water anâ make his word good.

Some folks used to kick againâ him and say he was worldly; but his
methods worked, anâ thatâs a good enough test for me. He took out the
shyness anâ the meanness anâ the stupidity, and gave the good parts a
chance to grow; which I take it is no more againâ religion than the
public school is. Why, he even taught âem card tricks.

He could take a deck of cards and turn it into a complete calendar,
leap year and all; and then he could turn it into a bible, showinâ
easy ways to learn things, until a feller really could believe âat
cards was invented by the early Christians who had to live in caves,
as some claim. All the time he was playinâ with âem, he was smugglinâ
in wise sayinâs with his fun, pointinâ out what made the difference
between deceivinâ for profit, and deceivinâ for a little joke, tellinâ
âem how to enjoy life without abusinâ itâWhy, he even went so far as
to say that if a feller couldnât be religious in a brandinâ pen he
couldnât be religious in a cathedralâwhich is a two-gun church with
fancy trimminâs.

By the time he had expanded the young folks and made âem easy and at
home, the older ones had arrived; and then he held a preachinâ. The
whole outfit joined in with the singinâ, and when he began to talk to
âem every eye in the room was glisteninâ. You see, he knew them and
their life; and they knew him and his. He had nursed âem through
sickness, he had tended their babies, he had helped to build their
cabins anâ turn âem into homes; so the words flowed out of his heart
and into theirs without any break between. This was the Friar and this
was his workâbut I canât put it into a story.

Theâ was a no-account cuss by the name oâ Jim Stubbs who livedâif ya
could call it livinââat Boggs; and the Friar induced him to go along
on one of his trips. When Jim came back he was a made-over man, and
every one asked him if he had religion. âHell, no,â sez Jim, tryinâ to
be independent, âI ainât got religion; but a feller catches somethinâ
from the Friar the same as if he had the measles; and I donât covet to
be a bum no more.â

This gives ya the best idy of the Friar that I can think of; and I
finally fell asleep there at Bill Duffâs, with my mind made up to bury
my own heartache, keep the grave of it green, but live out my life as
hard as the Friar was livinâ his.

We had intended to projec about in the Basin next day to rustle up
some new trade in the Friarâs line; but my pony turned up lame, so we
held over to get him shod. When the stage pulled in that eveninâ, me
anâ the Friar went down to see it. A little feller sat on the seat
with the driver. His hat was covered with dust anâ pulled down over
his eyes, anâ what ya could see of him was the color oâ coffee; but
the moment I lay eyes on his side-burns, I grabbed the Friarâs arm anâ
whispered, âHorace!â and by dad, thatâs who it was. Promotheus was in
the back seat, anâ he looked for all the world like an enlarged copy,
except that his side-burns were red anâ gray, while Horaceâs were
mostly brown. But they were cut exactly the same, startinâ from his
ears, runninâ across his cheeks anâ lips, anâ then curvinâ down to the
crook of his jaw, close cropped anâ bristly.

Horace anâ Promotheus hit the ground as soon as the stage stopped, anâ
me anâ the Friar dropped back out oâ sight inside the hotel. Horace
gave orders about his two boxes anâ started into the hotel. Just as he
came through the door, I stepped out anâ gave him a shove. âYou canât
come in here,â I growled.

He stepped back as fierce as a rattler. âI canât, huh?â he piped.
âWell, weâll see if I canât.â

Then he recognized me, anâ we began to pump hands. He said âat he and
Promotheus had only reached home three weeks before; but they couldnât
stand it, anâ so had made a streak for the West. He said they had been
in Africa anâ India, until they had become plumb disgusted with
tropical heat, anâ so had come out the northern route, expectinâ to
outfit at Bosco anâ ride down to the Diamond Dot.

We suppered with âem anâ next day they bought a string oâ hosses,
packed their stuff on âem, anâ said they were ready for some
amusement. Horace had got a little snappier in his talk anâ his
movements; but that was about the only change. As soon as we told âem
about Ty Jones havinâ a woman, that settled it. Horace insisted upon
seeinâ the woman, anâ Promotheus echoed anything âat Horace said,
though his face clouded a bit at the idee of foolinâ around the Cross
brand ranch. The Friar didnât feel any call to go along with us; but
it was more to my mind just then ân his line was, so I jumped at the
chance.

Horace was also mighty glad to add me to his outfit. He had been used
to havinâ a lot oâ Zulus anâ Hindus waitinâ on him, and hadnât
adjusted himself to a small outfit yet. He said he had sent a lot oâ
hides anâ heads anâ horns and other plunder from London, England, to
the Diamond Dot; but had been too busy to write durinâ the past few
years. He and the Friar had quite a talk together before we left; but
I could tell from their faces âat Horace didnât have any news for him.

We had high jinks when we reached Olafâs; but Horace didnât make any
hit with the kid. The kid had a jack-in-the-box toy âat looked
considâable like Horace, anâ the kid couldnât square things in his own
mind, to see a big size one, out anâ walkinâ about like a regular
human; but when he also got to studyinâ Promotheus, he was all undone.
Olaf tried to have him make up to Horace, but he wouldnât stand for
it. Heâd sit on Olafâs knee and look first at his jack-in-the-box,
then at Horace, and wind up with a long look at Promotheus. Promotheus
would try to smile kind anâ invitinâ, and then the kid would twist
around and bury his face in Olafâs vest. Horace nor Promotheus didnât
mind it any; but as far as that goes, the kid was only actinâ honest
anâ natural, accordinâ to his lights, anâ the jack-in-the-box had as
much of a kick cominâ as anybody.

Ty had been down there just the day after we had left, anâ had wanted
to buy Olafâs place; but only offered half what it was worth. He had
done this half a dozen times, anâ allus insulted Olaf as much as he
could about it. Olaf had wanted to sell out at first; but Kit had been
able to see âat they had a homestead fit for any thing, and she had
allus insisted that they get full price or hang on. Now, it was
improved way beyond common, anâ they were both fond of it; so they had
decided to stick it out.

âThis is goinâ to be a dry summer,â sez I.

Olafâs face clouded up but he only shut his lips tighter. We told âem
we were on our way up to try anâ have a look at Ty Jonesâs woman, and
Olaf said heâd go along if he didnât have to trail his cattle up to
the Raw Hide, this beinâ part oâ the deal he had made. He said it
would take him about ten days probably, anâ wanted us to camp in the
Spread, anâ keep an eye on his stuff. Olaf clipped the first joint off
oâ Promotheusâs name, anâ I was glad of it.

We chucked our stuff into the barn next morninâ anâ started to stalk
the Cross brand neighborhood. Horace had a small field glass which was
a wonder, and we worked as careful as we could. It was only fifteen
miles across from Olafâs; but all we were able to do the first day was
to find a little sheltered spot up back oâ the ranch buildinâs where
we could get a good view of âem through the field glass.

Next day Olaf anâ Oscar started with the bunch oâ cattle, anâ we rode
along part way with âem to give âem a good start; but Olaf had handled
his stuff so gentle that it was no trouble, anâ we turned back anâ
took up our watch again. We watched for a week without seeinâ a thing,
ridinâ in each night to sleep back of Olafâs shack. Me anâ TheusâI
had seen Olafâs ante anâ had raised him oneâwere gettinâ purty weary
oâ this sort oâ work; but Horace was as patient as a spider. Finally
though, we got a little more risky, and leavinâ our hosses up in our
sheltered spot, we follered down a ravine to get nearer to the new
cabin.

We had caught several glimpses of a woman to prove to us âat theâ was
one there; but that was about all, anâ so we went down this ravine,
tryinâ to figure out what excuse weâd give if we came across any of Ty
Jonesâs men. Neither me nor TheâPromotheus had said âat we couldnât
be no politer ân he could, so he had lopped off the last joint, and
now had as neat a workinâ name as any one, although Horace still
insisted on usinâ the whole outfit when he had occasion to address
him. Well, neither me nor The felt just easy in our minds at snoopinâ
about Tyâs when we hadnât any business to, especially The; but Horace
was as selfcomposed as though he was herdinâ lions out oâ tall grass,
which it seems had been his favorite pastime durinâ the last few
years.

The knew the ravine well; he said it ran full oâ water in the spring,
but after that was dry all the year. We got about half-way down it,
anâ then we came to a path âat was plain enough to see. The stopped
anâ wagged his head. âNo one ever used to use this,â sez he.

âWell, some one uses it purty constant, now,â sez I.

âThe woman is the one who uses it,â sez Horace. âSheâs lonely, thatâs
plain enough. The path climbs the opposite bankâletâs cross anâ go
up.â

Me anâ The bucked at this for some time; but Horace hung out; so we
went along with him. We finally came to a little glen with a spring in
it, anâ grass, and in a little clump oâ small trees, we came across a
book lyinâ face down on a Navajo blanket.

âThatâs gettinâ close,â sez Horace.

âYes!â sez we, in low tones.

We scouted all around; but no one was there, anâ then we took a line
on the hill back of us, picked out a likely spot, and returned the way
we had come, this beinâ the only direct way. We didnât meet a soulâat
least none wearinâ bodies, though from the creepy feelinâ I had part
of the time, I wonât ever be certain we didnât meet any souls.

Next day, we circled the peak and got up to the spot we had picked
out. We could see the clump oâ trees plain enough; and along about
three in the afternoon, we saw the woman come up the path, walkinâ
slow anâ actinâ weary. She had two big dogs with her, and whenever
sheâd stop to rest a bit, sheâd pet âem. âWell,â sez The, âthings has
changed a heap when olâ Ty Jones stands for havinâ his dogs patted.â

We couldnât get a good view of her face from where we were, but we
could get a fine view oâ the ranch buildinâs. Theâ didnât seem to be
much work on hand, and we saw eight or ten men foolinâ around anâ
pretendinâ to do chores. The recognized the two Greasers he had been
ridinâ with the day he had pulled on Horace, and one or two others;
but most of âem was strangers to him. He said the Greasers were about
the most devilish speciments he had ever herded withâanâ Tyâs whole
outfit was made up oâ fellers who had qualified to wear hemp.

Horace was keen to go on down to her anâ get a good look; but me anâ
The took the bits in our teeth at this. We knew what those dogs were
like, anâ refused pointblank to go a peg unless he could think up a
good enough excuse for us to give to Ty Jonesâand we wouldnât let
Horace go down alone.

âThe best plan I can see,â sez I, pointinâ to a cluster oâ big rocks
down the slope to the left, âis to circle back to those rocks. We can
see her face plain from there when she comes back the path.â

After examininâ this plan we decided it was the best; but when we went
after our hosses, Horaceâs had broke his reins anâ gone back through
the hills. By the time me anâ The had rounded him up, it was too late,
so we had to wait till next day.

Next day I left the other two at our first look-out and rode on to the
new one. As soon as she came in sight, I waved my hat to âem and they
sneaked down to the bunch oâ rocks. I rode back anâ left my hoss with
theirs, anâ then joined âem.

She didnât come into view till after five oâclock. When she reached
the edge of the ravine anâ started down, she paused anâ looked off
into the valley with her face in plain view. Horace looked at it
through his glasses, gave a start, and then handed the glasses to The.
âHave you ever seen any one who looked like her?â sez he.

The looked and broke out into a regular expression. âThatâs the
original of the photograph I had,â sez he.

âThatâs the Friarâs girl, sure as the skyâs above us,â sez Horace.

I grabbed the glass and took a look. She did look like the picture,
but older and more careworn. Some way I had allus thought oâ the
Friarâs girl as beinâ young and full of high spirits, with her head
thrown back anâ her eyes dancinâ; but just as I looked through the
glasses, she pressed her hands to her head, and her face was wrinkled
with pain. She was better lookinâ than common, but most unhappy.

âThat devil, Ty Jones, is mean to her!â I growled between my teeth.

âDogs or no dogs, Iâm goinâ down to have a talk with her,â sez Horace.

He started to get up, but I pulled him back to the ground. I had kept
my eyes on her, and had seen the two dogs turn their heads down the
ravine, and her own head turn with a jerk, as though some one had
called to her. Horace looked through the glasses again, and said he
could see her lips move as though talkinâ to some one, and then she
went down into the ravine. We couldnât see the bottom of the ravine
from where we were, nor we couldnât see the ranch buildinâs; so we
hustled back through some washes to our look-out, and reached it just
as she and Ty came out at the bottom.

They were walkinâ side by side, but Horace, who was lookinâ through
the glasses, said they seemed to be quarrelinâ. âItâs moonlight
to-night,â sez Horace, âand Iâm goinâ to sneak down and try to see
her.â

We argued againâ it all we could, but he stood firm; so all we could
do was to sit there and wait for the lights to go out in the
bunk-house. As she was a reader, we figured âat sheâd be the last one
to turn in; normal habits anâ appetites not havinâ much effect on
book-readers.




CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

JUSTICE UNDELAYED


Human emotions are like clocks: some of âem will run longer ân others;
but theyâll all run down unless theyâre wound up again every so often.
Even fear will only run so long, as several late-lamented bullies have
been forced to learn just before they passed over the Great Divide.
After youâve scared a feller as bad as he can get, it is well enough
to let him alone. If you keep on addinâ horror onto horror, his fear
is likely to run down; and the chances are âat heâll get irritated,
and slaughter ya.

I donât know whether or not patience can rightly be called an emotion;
but anyway, mine runs down a little easier ân airy other oâ my
faculties, and sittinâ up in the chill anâ waitinâ for a lot oâ
festive fools to go to bed, allus was just the sort oâ thing to
disgust me. Those Cross-branders didnât seem to have any more use for
shut-eye that night than a convention oâ owls. Some of âem rode off at
dusk, but more of âem arrived, and they held some sort of high jinks
in the bunk-house, till I began to talk back at myself loud enough for
all to hear. It was full moon anâ we could see dogs loafinâ anâ
fightinâ down at the ranch, the light in the new cabin was the first
to go out, anâ for the life of me, I couldnât see where we had a
single pair to stay on; but Horace seemed to accumulate obstinacy with
every breath he drew. The sided with me, but criticizinâ Horace went
againâ his religion, so he didnât make any more uproar than a gnat
fight.

Finally I calmed down until I could stretch each word out a full
breath anâ sez in my doviest voice: âHorace, will you kindly tell me
what in hell you intend to do?â

He studied the situation careful, and took all the time he needed to
do it. âIâm goinâ back to camp,â sez he. âTo-morrow night theyâll be
sleepy, and weâll have the whole place to ourselves.â

âHurrah for hot weather! Greece has finally melted!â I yelled, anâ we
hustled for our ponies.

I have a buck-skin rigginâ I put on the bridle of a hoss who gets into
the evil way of steppinâ on his reins; and I had fixed one on Horaceâs
hoss to bring him back to his senses should he attempt to play the
same trick he had worked on us the day before. When a hoss wearinâ one
oâ these contrivances steps on his reins it pinches his ears, down
close to his head where theyâre tender, and generally works a
reformation in short order.

We forgot all about this, and when Horace jumped into his saddle, he
gave a jerk on the reinsâand got bucked into a clump oâ cactus. The
hoss didnât try any runninâ, though, which proves he had learned a
proper respect for trailinâ reins. Still, Horace wasnât quite in the
mood to see the beauty oâ my method, so he insisted upon my swappinâ
hosses with him. It was a good two-hoursâ ride to Olafâs, and by the
time we had changed saddles, and I had convinced the pony that his
idees of buckinâ were childish anâ fu-tile, and his show of temper had
only given him a hundred anâ ninety pounds to carry instead of a
hundred anâ twenty, it was after nine oâclock.

We were hungry enough to call for speed; but still it was eleven by
the time we reached the Spread. We thought we had seen a horseman go
into it from the other direction; but the moon had ducked under a
cloud and we couldnât be certain.

We didnât intend to waken Kit if we could help it; so we started to
put the hosses into the corral as quiet as possible. Just as we had
thrown our saddles over the top bar, we heard a commotion from the
cabin, and started for it on the run.

There wasnât any light in the cabin; but we heard Kit screaminâ, and
before we arrived, we saw a man rush around the corner just as the
door was flung open, and two other men jumped towards him from the
inside. These two had knives in their hands; and the man outside took
a step back. They rushed him, but he hit one with his right fist, and
the other with his left, and curled âem both up againâ the side oâ the
house in a way to make a fellerâs heart dance for joy. Then we saw it
was the Friar himself, and we gave a whoop.

Kit had banged the door shut, put up the bar, got a rifle and made
ready for what was to come next; but when she heard our whoop, she put
on her wrapper and opened the door. The two men âat the Friar had
crumpled up were those same two Greasers âat The had told us were the
meanest pair he had ever herded with.

We took âem by the heels anâ straightened âem out, while Kit indulged
in a few little hystericals. The Friar had allus been a great hand to
expound upon moral force anâ spiritual force, and such items, and now
when the two Greasers refused to come back anâ claim their own bodies,
he got a little fidgetty.

âFriar,â I sez, âI give in to you. Your quiet way oâ lettinâ the right
work out its own salvation is the surest way I know; and in an
emergency like this, it does full as well as violence.â

The Friar wasnât in no mood for hilarity, though; so after gettinâ
their weapons anâ tyinâ âem up, we soused the Greasers with water, and
brought âem back to give an account oâ themselves, Kit all the time
tellinâ us what had happened.

It seems âat Kit had been hoeinâ in her beloved garden that day anâ
had been purty tired at night; so after waitinâ for us until she got
exasperated, she had eaten her own supper, put ours on the table, anâ
turned in. Olaf had put up another cabin the same size as his first.
He had put âem side by side with a porch joininâ at their eaves. In
one cabin was the dininâ room anâ kitchen, all in one, and in the
other was the bedroom anâ settinâ room.

Kit had heard a noise in the settinâ room and had opened the door
before she was full awake, thinkinâ it was the dog or cat. The minute
she had opened the door they had grabbed her, and she had begun to
scream. They shut off her wind a little; but they wasnât rough with
herâquite the contrary. They leered into her eyes, and patted her on
the shoulders, and made queer, gurglinâ noises in their dirty brown
throats; but they didnât speak to her, not one word.

Kit was strong, anâ she had fought âem to a standstill for what she
thinks was twenty minutes, at least; but she was beginninâ to weaken.
One of âem kept his arm about her neck, and whenever she tried to
scream, shut off her wind. She had heard the Friarâs hoss nicker when
he opened the first pole gate, and this provided her with enough moral
courage to sink her teeth into the wrist of the arm about her neck.
The feller had give a yell, and struck her; but at the same time, she
had opened up a scream of her own which loosened things all over the
neighborhood.

The Friar had first put for the settinâ room door; but they had locked
this door on the inside, intendinâ to go out the side door. He savvied
this so he dove into the porch-way between the two cabins, and made a
rattlinâ on this door. They had paused at this; but he had to rattle
several times before they took down the front bar. We had been fordinâ
the crick about this time.

The Greasers had tried to get out the window once; but Kit had called
out what they were up to; so they had turned on her anâ choked and
beat her scandalous.

This was Kitâs side, and by the time she had finished tellinâ it, the
Greasers had begun to moan anâ toss. The Friar gave a sigh of relief,
as soon as they came to enough to begin grittinâ their teeth. I sat
âem up with their backs againâ the side of the cabin, and intimated
that we were ready to receive their last words.

We had to encourage âem a bit, one way or another; but we finally got
out of âem that they had poisoned the dog, and then cut a crack in the
door till they could raise the bar. They said âat Ty Jones hadnât had
no hand in planninâ their trip; but had offered âem a hundred apiece
if they could put Olaf in the mood of wishinâ he had sold out
peaceable.

âWell,â sez I, as soon as they were through, âshall we finish with âem
to-night, or give âem till to-morrow to repent?â

âWe shall of course deliver them to the proper officials to be tried
by due process of law,â sez the Friar.

âWhat for?â sez I. âYa never can tell how a trial will turn out; but
we know âat they have forfeited the right to live; so weâll just give
âem what theyâve earned and save all fuss.â

âNo good ever comes of men taking the law into their own hands,â sez
the Friar firmly.

âHow come, then, that you didnât run anâ tell some justice oâ the
peace, âat these two snakes was actinâ disrespectfulâinstead of
knockinâ âem up againâ the logs?â sez I.

âI should have done so if I had had time,â sez the Friar with dignity.

âWell, youâre better trained ân we are,â sez I; âbut it still takes a
little time for you to make your hands mind your self-control, after
youâve been het up. You can do it in ten minutes, say; but it takes us
about a week, and by that time theâ wonât be any need for the law.â

âNo,â sez the Friar, âI insist that we rely upon the law. We count
ourselves as of the better element; and the most vicious conditions
arise when the better element takes the law into its own hands. When a
vicious man does illegal violence, it does not establish a precedent;
but when the decent man does the same thing, it tears away forms of
civilization which have taken centuries to construct.â

âThat sounds like sense,â sez I; âand after this is all over, I donât
mind arguinâ it out with you; but right now, it would seem to me that
if we went to law about this, it would be because we wanted to
shoulder onto the law the responsibility of doinâ what we feel ought
to be done, but which we havenât the nerve to do ourselves.â

âIf you attempt to lynch these men, I shall ride at once and give the
alarm,â sez the Friar.

âAnd when you came back, you would find âem swinginâ from a limb,â sez
I. âIâm with you in most things, Friar, and if theâ was a shred oâ
doubt, Iâd be with you in this; but itâs too plain a case. Iâm willinâ
to hold these two in secret until we can collect a posse oâ twelve to
give âem a jury trial; but this is the most Iâll do. Ty Jones has got
others of his gang away from the law, but he donât get these twoânot
if I can help it.â

Horace sided with me, and so did The, though he didnât have much to
say. He was thinkinâ of his own trip to pester Olaf, and it came back
to him purty strong. The Friar finally had to agree not to notify the
law until Iâd had time to gather up a posse. I made Horace promise not
to tell the Friar about our seeinâ the woman back at Tyâs, saw that
the Greasers were planted safe in Olafâs log barn, and set out at once
for the Diamond Dot on a fresh hoss. I never want to eat none before
startinâ a ride like this.

I rode all that night through the moonlight; swinginâ up over the
passes, fordinâ the rivers, and reachinâ the Diamond Dot at noon the
next day. I didnât let on to Jabez âat I was there at all; but I got
Spider Kelley, olâ Tank Williams, Tillte Dutch, and Mexican Slim to
take a vacation and come on back with me. This gave five for the jury,
as I didnât intend to have Horace or The sit on it, not knowinâ how
far their prejudice might prevent âem from executinâ my idee of
justice. We set out to return, about five oâclock, and rode into the
Spread at seven the next morninâ with eight other fellers we had
brought along for good measure.

Old Jimmy Simpson and his four grown sons were in this bunch, and I
was purty well acquainted with âem. I knew âat they had been amply
pestered by Ty Jonesâs outfit, and wouldnât be too particular about
what book-law might have to say on the subject, though olâ man Simpson
was up on book-law. The other three were fellers they knew and were
willinâ to guarantee. We were all a little sleepy, so we decided to
hold the trial after dinner.

The Friar had spent as much time with the Greasers as theyâd stand
for; but he hadnât made much impression on âem. I knew âat he was
heart-whole in his attitude, anâ I hated to cross him; but this was a
case oâ principle with me, so when we got ready for the trial, I tried
to get him to take a long walk, but he refused.

We held the trial in front oâ the barn, and it was as legal as any
trial ever was, and as solemn, too. We untied the prisoners, and
called Kit for the first witness. She told it just as she had told it
to us, but her bruised face would have been all that was necessary.
Then we called the Friar and he told his part, and we let him make a
speech in favor oâ law and order; and cheered him hearty, too, when he
got through.

I had just begun to give my part, when Olaf and Oscar rode up. Olaf
sat on his hoss and looked at us a moment, at Kit with her bruised
face, holdinâ the boy in her arms, at the prisoners and us; and then
he asked the Friar what it all meant. The Friar was sunonomous with
truth, as far as Olaf was concerned.

Olaf listened quietly, the dark red risinâ in his cheeks beinâ about
the only change in him. When the Friar finished, Olaf got off his
hoss. âTheâ wonât be need of any more trial,â sez he. âKit, you go to
the house.â

Kit started for the house, and the Friar asked Olaf what he intended
to do.

âKill âem,â sez Olaf, âwith my two hands.â

He unbuckled his belt and threw it on the ground, then kicked off his
chaps, and stepped through the ring we had formed. âStop,â said the
Friar. âOlaf, I forbid this.â

âYou had better go to the house, Friar,â said Olaf with pleadinâ in
his voice. âGo inâplease go inâanâ comfort Kit.â

The Friar made a rush, but we fended him off. The Greasers also tried
to make a get-away; and between the three of âem we were some busy;
but it didnât last long. When the Greasers saw they couldnât break our
ring, they turned on Olaf like cornered rats. They struck him and they
choked him; but not once did he speak, and whenever his grip closed on
their flesh, he ruined that part forever. It was a horrid sight; but I
couldnât have turned my eyes away if Iâd wanted to. In the end he
broke their necks, one after the other, and then he stood up straight
and wiped his forehead. âI take the blame,â said he. âI take all the
blame, here and hereafterâ; which certainly was a square thing to do,
though we hadnât counted on it, any.




CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

THE FRIAR GOES ALONE


The Friar had been in earnest tryinâ to get to Olaf; so âat the four
Simpson boys had finally been forced to throw, anâ sit on him. As soon
as it was over, they got up and apologized, offerinâ to let him take
out any spite on âem he saw fit, and promisinâ not to feel any
ill-will; but the Friar wasnât angry. He was hurt and sad to think âat
weâd do such a thing; but he had no resentment towards us.

âI know most of you men well,â said he; âand I know you have done this
because you felt it was right. I donât put you on one side and myself
on the other. I take my full share oâ the blame. It merely proves that
my influence with you during the many years we have been together has
not been for the best, and I am very sorry to learn how poor my work
has been.â

He turned and went up to the house; and we all felt nearly as bad
about the way he had taken it as though the confounded Greasers had
got away altogether. We talked it over and finally loaded their bodies
into Olafâs wagon, and hauled âem up on the rim, where we buried âem
and heaped a lot oâ stones over âem. We began to feel better after
this, and shook hands all around, and the Simpsons and their three
friends rode away.

Then we told the others about havinâ seen the Friarâs girl at Ty
Jonesâs and held a council as to how we should tell him. We finally
delegated Horace to do it, though he wasnât ambitious for the job. The
Friar had told Kit that it was all over, and had left to take a walk
without eatinâ any supper. We still felt purty low-spirited, and we
didnât eat much ourselves; though we felt certain he wouldnât bother
his head much about a couple oâ Greasers, as soon as he found out his
own girl was Ty Jonesâs woman.

The boys had come light from the Diamond Dot, but Horace had outfitted
way beyond his needs, intendinâ to do considâable campinâ around, and
Olaf also had a couple of extra tarps and plenty oâ beddinâ; so we
fixed up our old bunk-shack which had been left standinâ, and settled
down as though the interval between our previous visit hadnât been
more ân ten days.

The Friar came back about ten oâclock. He came into our shack as quiet
as he could; but Horace was sittinâ before the fire waitinâ for him.
It was a warm night; but we had built the fire to make it a little
more cheerful, and had left the door wide open. Horace saw the Friar
the minute he reached the doorway, and he got up and went outside with
him.

They were gone nearly an hour, and then Horace sneaked in, and wakened
me up. I follered him outside; and he said that the Friar intended to
ride down to see Ty Jones as soon as it was day, and that he insisted
on ridinâ alone. The Friar was walkinâ up and down in the moonlight,
his face was all twisted up, through his tryinâ to hold it calm, when
I took my turn at reasoninâ with him; but it wasnât any use.

âWell, youâll not go alone,â I said at last; âand you can make up your
mind to that now. We donât know how much Ty already knows about our
puttinâ the Greasers out oâ the game, and we donât know how much of it
heâll lay to you; but we do know that he hates you, and would wipe
your name off the list the first good chance he had. Iâm goinâ along.â

The Friar was hot; we stood there in the moonlight facinâ each other
and takinâ each otherâs measures. He was a shade taller and some
heavier ân I was; and ya could see âat heâd have given right smart to
have felt free to mix it with me. âDo you think Iâm a baby?â he burst
out. âDo you think âat Iâm not fit to be trusted out oâ your sight?
You take entirely too much on yourself, Happy Hawkins!â

I didnât want to taunt him to hurt himâIâd rather been kicked by a
hoss than to do thisâbut I did want to arouse him to a sense oâ the
truth. âYou have adjusted yourself to this locality purty well,
Friar,â sez I; âbut theâs still a lot you donât quite savvy. Some
cases must be settled by a man himself, but some must be left to the
law. If this woman is the wife oâ Ty Jones, he has the law on his
side.â

He turned from me and stamped off into the night with his hands
clenched. He disappeared in the cottonwoods, and I was just beginninâ
to wonder if I hadnât better foller him, when he came back again. âOh,
Iâve been a fool, Iâve been a fool!â he cried. âAll my life I have
tried not to judge others, but all my life I have judged them. I have
tried to put myself in their place, but allus I judged and condemned
them for giving way to temptations which I felt that I, in their
place, could have resisted. I have been a fool, and I still am a fool.
I admit that you are right, and I am wrongâbut, I am going to Ty
Jonesâs at dawn, and Iâm goinâ alone.â

Well, that settled itâme anâ the Friar had to buck each other again.
He continued to stalk up anâ down through moonlight and shadow; while
I tried to plan a way to head him off. I was dead sleepy, but I went
around and wakened up all the other fellers, and told âem not to get
up in the morninâ until called; next I got Tank to help me, and we
waited until the Friar had walked in the opposite direction, and then
we took the ponies out oâ the corral and headed âem toward the hills.
The farther we got, the rougher with âem we got, and then we turned
our own mounts loose, and sent âem after the bunch. It was a big job
to pack our saddles back on our heads, but we did it, and tore down
the fences to pertend âat the ponies had vamoosed on their own hook.
Horace was walkinâ with the Friar now, arguinâ the benefit of a little
sleep, so âat heâd be at his best. After a time the Friar did go to
bed in Horaceâs tarp in the corner.

I didnât wake up till after seven, myself, and all the fellers were
pertendinâ to sleep as though it wasnât more ân three. The Friar
didnât wake up till eight. He was beside himself when he found the
ponies gone; but he ate breakfast as calm as he could, and then set
out with us to wrangle in some hosses on foot.

Goinâ after hosses on foot is sufficiently irritatinâ to a ridinâ
outfit to make it easy enough to believe âat this was all an accident,
and we didnât come up with the ponies till nearly noon. When we
cornered âem up, I never in my life saw as much poor ropinâ, nor as
much good actinâ; but we finally got enough gentle ones to ride
bareback, so we could wrangle in the rest; and after a quick lunch,
the Friar started to make his hoss ready.

We all started along with him. He stopped and faced on us, givinâ us a
long, cold look-over. You can say all you want to againâ swearinâ, but
theâs times when it springs out of its own accord in a man, as natural
and beautiful and satisfyinâ as the flowers blossom forth on the
cactus plants; and I havenât a shred of doubt that if the Friar had
handed us some oâ the remarks that came ready-framed to his tongue
just then, theyâd have been well worth storinâ up for future needs;
but all he did was to fold his arms, and say: âYour methods are not my
methods. I am not goinâ there to start trouble, and I do not even wish
to give them the slightest excuse to start it of their own vo-lition.
If you are my friends, you will respect my wishes.â

âWell, but youâll take at least one of us along, wonât ya, Friar?â sez
olâ Tank. âLikely as not we wouldnât take it up, nohow; but still if
they made away with ya, weâd sort oâ like to know about it as early as
possible, in order not to feel suspensed any longer ân was necessary.â

âI should like to take one man along as a guide, as I am not entirely
familiar with the trail from here,â sez the Friar, still talkinâ to us
as though we were a lot of evil-lookinâ strangers. âIf one of you were
to go along until we came within sight oâ the ranch buildinâsâNo,
they might see him and get the idee that he had gone back to join a
reserve body, and I do not wish them to have the slightest grounds for
resorting to force on their side. I shall have to go alone.â

âI can see what youâve been drivinâ at, now,â sez Tank, whose face was
so muddled up that no one ever tried to read his thoughts in his
features, and so he could lie with impunity. âYes, I can see what you
mean, now, and I got to own up âat youâre right about it. Still, you
know, Friar, weâre bound to worry about ya. How long do you want us to
wait before we start to projectinâ around to get some news of ya?â

A look of relief came to the Friarâs face: âWhy, if I donât come back
within a week,â sez he, âI havenât any objections to your notifyinâ
the legal authorities that you fear something has happened to meâbut
donât make much fuss, for it doesnât really matter.â

We all kicked about waitinâ a week, but finally compromised on five
days as beinâ about the right interval to allow before notifyinâ the
legal authorities. Then we advised the Friar to go down by the ravine
as it would take him to the ranch by the back way where he wouldnât be
so likely to attract attention, especially from the dogs.

He asked Horace to ride with him until he could get a landmark; so
Horace flung his saddle on a hoss anâ started along, while the rest of
us made ready to go trout-fishinâ, or take a snooze, or shake the
cards, accordinâ to the way we generally amused ourselves when
loafinâ. The Friar turned back once on the pretense that he wanted to
get a good drink oâ water before startinâ; but he found us scattered
out peaceful anâ resigned, so he headed away at good speed.

Horace took him the open road, while we went mostly through cuts, the
way we had allus gone to our look-out. Our way was some the longer;
but we pushed our hosses a little more, and made the look-out just as
the Friar reached the point where the path went down into the ravine.
Horace had agreed to do all he could to get the Friar to go up to the
clump of bushes where the woman spent her afternoons, though he said
he doubted if the Friar would do it.

I had the field glasses with me, and kept âem on the Friarâs face when
he paused to examine the spot and make sure he was right. He couldnât
see the ranch buildinâs from where he was, nor the path leadinâ to the
clump of trees. I could see his face plain through the glasses, and he
had taken the guy ropes off and let it sag into just the way he felt.
It was filled with pain anâ sufferinâ.

As soon as Horace came, he and I sneaked down to the bunch oâ big
rocks from which we could see the path as it dipped from the opposite
edge of the ravine, leavinâ the rest of the boys to watch the ranch
buildinâs. We could see them from where we were, and they could see
us, and we had a signal for us to come back, or them to come to us;
and another that the Friar was gettinâ it bad down below, and to make
a rush for him. We hadnât seen any one about the buildinâs, except the
Chinese cook. Our plan was to not rush the buildinâs right away,
unless we saw the Friar gettinâ manhandled beyond his endurance.
Horace said âat the Friar had refused to go to the clump oâ trees to
see the woman, as it might give the impression that she had sent word
to him to meet her there, and he wouldnât cast the slightest suspicion
upon her name.

âHorace,â I said, as an awful fear struck me, âsupposinâ after all, it
ainât the right woman!â

Horaceâs eyes stuck out like the tail lights on a freight caboose.
âOh, Iâm sure itâs the same woman,â sez he. âCourse sheâs changed
some; but we couldnât all three be mistaken.â

âI still think itâs the same woman,â sez I; âbut as far as all three
not beinâ mistaken, theâs nothinâ to that. Half oâ the fellers who
make bets are mistaken, and most of us make bets. Still I think sheâs
the same woman.â

In spite of this doubt, I was feelinâ purty comfortable. The other
time we had been there, I hadnât been able to think up any excuse as
to why; but this time I felt I was in right and it left me free to
enjoy the prospects of a little excitement. I allus try to be honest
with myself; and when Iâm elated up over anything, I generally aim to
trail back my feelinâs to their exact cause. Iâm bound to admit that
when Iâm certain that any trouble likely to arise will be thrust upon
me in spite of my own moral conduct, I allus take a pleasant
satisfaction in waitinâ for it.

The Friar slid his hoss down the bank oâ the ravine, and disappeared
just a few moments before we saw the woman cominâ along the path from
the clump of trees. We kept glancinâ up at the look-out now and again,
but mostly we glued our eyes on the woman. Horace hogged the field
glasses most oâ the time, but my eyes were a blame sight better ân
his, so I didnât kick about it much.

When she reached the edge oâ the ravine, she paused and gave a little
start. âDoes she know him, Horace?â I sez.

âShe donât seem to,â sez Horace. âSheâs speakinâ down at him; but her
face looks as though she didnât know him.â

âIf itâs the wrong woman,â sez I, âIâm goinâ to start to the North
Pole to locate the fool-killer.â

While I spoke, she started down the path slow and matter oâ fact; and
me anâ Horace scuttled back to the look-out to be in time to see âem
come out at the bottomâprovidinâ the Friar went on with her.

We didnât get there more ân two minutes before they came out at the
bottom; but it seemed a week. When they finally came into sight, the
Friar was walkinâ anâ leadinâ his hoss, and she was walkinâ at his
side about four feet from him with a big dog on each side of her. Just
then we saw six Cross-branders ride in toward the corral.

âIt looks calm anâ quiet,â drawled olâ Tank, his free eye bouncinâ
about like a rubber ball; âbut Iâll bet two cookies againâ the hole in
a doughnut that we have a tolâable fair sized storm before morninâ.â




CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

THE FRIAR GIVEN TWO WEEKS


As Friar Tuck and the woman came out of the mouth of the ravine, Ty
Jones came out of the back door of the old cabin. He stopped a moment,
lookinâ at âem, rubbed his eyes anâ looked again. Then he walked
towards âem. He spoke somethinâ to the Friar, and the Friar answered
it. The woman didnât pay any heed at all; but went around the new
cabin to the door which was on the other side. Three more
Cross-branders rode in, and Ty Jones shook his fist at the Friar.

Olâ Tank was cussinâ under his breath for comfort, but it didnât keep
him from gettinâ fidgetty. âIsnât theâ no sort of a tool, Horace,â he
blurted out, âthatâll stretch out your hearinâ the way these field
glasses stretch out your eyesight? Iâd be willinâ to have one of my
ears run as wild as my free eye, forever after, if it could just hear,
now, what Ty Jones is a-speakinâ to the Friar. Iâm beginninâ to get
nervous.â

We all felt about the same way; but it was about two miles down to
where they were, so all we could do was to watch.

Olaf had come with us, leavinâ Oscar with Kit, and now Horace turned
to him and said: âYou and Promotheus know more about Ty Jones ân the
rest of us. I have never tried to pump Promotheus, but now I want you
to tell us what you think heâll do with the Friar.â

They said âat Ty was generally purty cold blooded, and likely to take
enough time in gettinâ rid of a feller to make it purty hard to tell
just how it had been done; but that when he once let go of himself, he
didnât care what happened, and if the Friar angered him about the
woman, the chances were âat the Friar would never leave the ranch
alive.

The shadows were beginninâ to fall, down in the valley; but Ty and the
Friar kept on talkinâ, Ty wavinâ his hands now and again, while the
Friar stood straight with his hands hanginâ easy at his side. I
couldnât stand it any longer.

âI believe âat a feller could get almost to âem without beinâ seen, by
goinâ along the edge oâ the ravine,â sez I; âand Iâm goinâ to do it.
Itâll be dark in a few minutes. If you want me to hustle to the Friar,
wave a torch up and down; if you want me to come back here, wave it
sideways.â

âIâm goinâ, too,â sez Horace.

âSo âm I,â sez Olaf and The.

âWell, thatâs full enough,â sez I, âand the rest of ya keep a sharp
watch, and also keep the hosses ready, in case we need âem.â

The four of us started down the side oâ the slope at good speed. There
were only two places on the way down where we caught sight oâ the
ranch buildinâs; but just before we reached the top oâ the cliff, we
heard a sound down below in the ravine. Glancinâ cautious over the
side, I saw the Friar cominâ back alone, on foot and leadinâ his hoss.

I drew back and whispered to the others, and we felt purty blame
cheap. We hardly knew what to do, as the Friar was likely to see us if
we tried to run back to our look-out before he reached the place where
the path came up out oâ the ravine, and most of all, we didnât want
him to know âat we were follerinâ him.

He had passed us by this time, so we looked over the edge oâ the
ravine at him. He was walkinâ slow with his head down, and his hands
in his pockets. âHeâll ride home slow,â sez I; âand we can easy beat
him.â

âHush,â sez The, dragginâ us back from the edge, âtheâs two fellers
follerinâ him.â

âHorace,â I said, quick and firm, so as not to have any back-talk,
âyou go about forty yards up the ravine, and keep your eyes on these
fellers. Donât shoot âem unless they try to pass you. Hurry, now! Iâve
given you the most important post. If you shoot, shoot in earnest.â

Horace stooped over and ran to where a rock jutted out. âNow, then,â
sez I, âas soon as these fellers pass us, weâll try to bowl âem over
with one stone each, and then drop back out oâ sight. We donât want to
shoot unless we have to.â

âTheyâre wavinâ us to come back,â whispered The, who had took a glance
at our look-out.

âNever mind,â sez I, lookinâ down and seeinâ the two fellers crouched
over and sneakinâ after the Friar. âNow then, throw and drop back.â

We stood on our knees, threw one stone each, and dropped back. They
rattled in the ravine below, and we heard a sharp yelp of pain. I had
only dodged away from the edge of the ravine and ran to where Horace
was.

âOne feller was hit in the shoulder and knocked down,â sez he; âbut he
got up again right away, and both of âem ran back.â

âWhat did the Friar do?â I asked, not darinâ to look over, lest he see
me.

âHe turned around and started back,â sez Horace. âI was afraid heâd
see my head againâ the sky, so I pulled it back. I havenât heard him
move since those fellers started to run.â

âWell, I donât believe âat even the Friar would be daffy enough to go
back,â sez I; âso weâll just lay here and listen. They signalled us
from above a while back, but theyâve stopped again.â

We waited some time without hearinâ any one pass us, and then we
sneaked up along the edge of the ravine. Before long we saw the Friar
come up the side. He paused on top and looked back, then mounted and
started for Olafâs at a slow shuffle. As soon as he was well under
way, we pushed for the look-out, and mounted.

âSlim, you and Tillte wouldnât be missed as soon as the rest of us; so
you trail the Friar, while we try to beat him home,â sez I. âIf you
need us, shoot. Otherwise come in as unnoticeable as youâre able.â

We reached Olafâs, had our saddles off and the hosses turned loose
before the Friar rode in. His face was white, but this was the only
thing âat showed what he was goinâ through. We made a big fuss about
his gettinâ back all right and asked him plenty oâ questions, without
overdoinâ it enough to make him suspicious. He answered our questions
right enough, but he didnât open up and talk free. Slim and Tillte
joined us at supper without beinâ noticed.

After supper we gathered around the fire in Olafâs settinâ room, and
the Friar gave us a purty complete account of what had happened. He
said that it was his old girl all right; but he said that theâ was
somethinâ the matter with her, that she didnât recognize him even
after he had made himself known to her. He said she seemed dazed-like
and not to take any interest in anything.

He said they had walked down the ravine together, and she had told him
that she was comfortable enough but not happy. That she had lost
something which she could not find; but that she was getting stronger
since havinâ come out to the mountains. He said âat when Ty Jones saw
âem together, he had carried on somethinâ fierce, and had ordered her
into the house. Then he had turned on the Friar and told him that he
would give him two weeks to leave the state and after that his life
wouldnât be safe in it. He said he had tried to reason with Ty; but it
wasnât any use; so he had just come away.

âIf he had set upon you, would you have shot him?â asked Tank.

âI didnât have anything to shoot him with,â sez the Friar. âI was
careful to leave my weapons behind.â

âWell, you didnât show much judgment in doinâ it,â sez Tank. âHe might
have sent a couple oâ fellers after ya, and finished you out in the
dark somewhere so âat we never could âaâ proved it on him.â

âI did think for a minute that some one was follerinâ me,â sez the
Friar. âI heard a rattle of stones and a cry a few hundred feet behind
me in the ravine; but I think it was some animal slippinâ down the
side.â

âLike as not,â sez Tank. âIf it had been any oâ Tyâs gang, they
wouldnât have give it up so easy; but another time weâll some of us go
along with you; so as to get your last words anyhow, if so be âat
youâre bent on suicide. What do you intend to do now?â

âThatâs the worst of it,â sez the Friar. âI donât know what to do. She
said she did not think she was married; but she was not sure; and Ty
refused to give me any satisfaction about it.â

âIsnât theâ any law out here, at all?â sez Horace. âSeems to me as
though there ought to be some way to get at Ty Jones.â

âWhat would you charge him with?â asked the Friar. âShe is not being
abused or kept a prisoner, she says she is comfortable and gettinâ
strongerâI canât think of any way to bring him under the law. If you
had not taken the law into your own hands in regard to his two men, we
might have made the claim that he was behind them in this; but really,
I do not see where we have any just grounds to go to law.â

âThat little matter oâ the Greasers donât hobble us none,â sez olâ
Tank. âDonât you get the idee that youâre bound in any way by this.
The whole country would uphold us; so if you want to use it as a
lever, just make your claims againâ Ty to the law officers, and weâll
tell âem âat the Greasers confessed âat Ty put âem up to it.â

This seemed to us like sage advice; and we all chipped in and urged
the Friar to act on it. Laws are all right, I havenât a word to say
againâ laws. Fact is, I believe âat weâre better off for havinâ a few
than not; but after all, laws come under the head of luxuries like
diamonds and elevators and steam heat. We all know there is such
things, and we havenât any objections to those usinâ âem who can
afford it; but most of us have to wear cut-glass, pack in our own
wood, do our climbinâ on foot or hossback, and settle our troubles in
our own way with as little bother as possible. When you figure it down
to the foundation, laws depend on public opinion, not public opinion
on laws; and all the public opinion worth takinâ into account would
have said âat we had done the right thing with those Greasers. If
theyâd âaâ tried to law us for a little thing like this, it would have
started an upraisinâ which would have let the law see how small a
shadow it really does throw when it comes to a show-down.

The Friar didnât answer us right away, and when he did, it was in the
most discouraged voice Iâd ever heard him use. âIâm in the dark,
boys,â sez he, âI donât know what to do. Even if I could find some way
to take her away from Ty Jones, I do not know what to do with her. She
is not herself, she needs care and protectionâand I am not in a
position to supply them. I have an income of three hundred and fifty
dollars a year, which is much more than enough for my own needs, for I
live mostly upon the hospitality of my friends as you well knowââwe
also knew âat he spent most of his money in helpinâ those who never
saw enough money to get on intimate terms with it; while all they gave
him in return was a little meal and bacon for savinâ their souls and
doctor-bills. âI donât know what I could do for her, even if I had the
right to take her away from him,â continued the Friar. âMy life has
been a good deal of a failure; and Iââ

âFor the love oâ common sense, Friar!â broke in Horace. âYou donât
seem to have the smallest degree oâ judgment. You know mighty well âat
Iâm bothered to death to know what to do with my money. You get her if
you can, send her to any sort of a sanitarium you want to, and Iâll
foot the bills. Donât you ever sit around and whine about money in my
presence again. It worries and disgusts and irritates meâand I came
out here for rest. You talk about faith and takinâ no heed for the
morrow, and such things; but you act as though you were riskinâ a
manâs soul when you gave him a chance to be of some little use in the
world.â

The Friar was purty well overcome at this; but figure on it the best
we were able, we couldnât see just how to get a manâs wife away from
him without provinâ that he had abused her. It was a complication, any
way we looked at it; so we all went to bed in the hope that one of us
would have a lucky dream.

We didnât have any more idees next morninâ than weâd had the night
before; so after breakfast, the Friar took a walk and the rest of us
sat around in bunches talkinâ it over. About ten oâclock a feller
named Joyce who lived about fifteen miles east of Olaf came by on his
way for a doctor, his boy havinâ been kicked above the knee and his
leg broke. The Friar could patch up a human as good as any doctor; so
we went after him, knowinâ that this would be the best way to take his
mind off his own troubles, and theâ was a look oâ relief in the
Friarâs face when he rode away with Joyce.

I never knew any feller yet who didnât spend a lot oâ time wishinâ he
had a chance to loaf all the laziness out of his system; but the fact
of the matter is, that work gives us more satisfaction than anything
else. A wild animalâs life is one long stretch after enough to eat;
but heâs full oâ health anâ joy anâ beauty. On the other hand, put one
in a cage and feed it regular and it turns sick immediate. What we
need is plenty oâ the kind oâ work we are fitted forâthis is the
answer to all our discontented feelinâ; and what the Friar was best
fitted for, was to help others.




CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR

A CROSS FOR EVERY MAN


Thinkinâ, just plain thinkinâ, is about the hardest work theâ is; and
for the next several days, we lay around doinâ mighty little else. The
trouble was, âat we couldnât devise a way to put Ty Jones out oâ
business. He wasnât an outlaw; fact was, he stood high with the big
cattle men; and we got light headed tryinâ to scare up a plan which
would remove Ty in a decent manner, and leave the Friar free to take
the woman without causinâ him any conscience-pains. We were the
mournfulest lookinâ bunch oâ healthy men ever I saw; and finally I
decided to loaf with Kit and the kid, they not beinâ expected to do
any thinkinâ and therefore havinâ smooth anâ pleasant faces.

Sometimes I wonder if women donât get along just as well without
thinkinâ as men do with it. I hadnât talked seven minutes with Kit
before she suggested just what I would have thought up if Iâd been
able. She didnât even know she had suggested it; so I didnât call her
attention to it for fear it might up-heave her vanity and give Olaf
bother. I had a plan now and it was of such a nature that I was glad
the Friar wasnât there to mess into it.

I found Promotheus anâ Tank lyinâ on the grass along the crick. They
were back to back, and their faces were so lined with genuwine
thought, that they looked like a pair of overgrown nutmegs. I sat down
beside âem lookinâ worried.

Presently Tank sez: âWhat ya thinkinâ about?â

I shook my head, and in about half an hour The asked the same
question. I waited a minute, hove out a sigh, and sez: âGee, I wish I
was you.â

âWhy do you wish you was me?â sez he.

ââCause,â sez I, âyouâve got a chance to do the biggest deed I know
of.â

âWhat is it?â sez he, examininâ my face to see if I was sheepinâ him.

âNo,â sez I, shakinâ my head; âI ainât got any right to even think of
it, let alone hint at it. You might think I was buttinâ into your
affairs, and then againâNo, I refuse to suggest it. If itâs your
duty, youâll see it yourself; but I wonât take the responsibility of
pointinâ it out.â

âWhat in thunder did you mention it at all for, then?â sez The,
gettinâ curious anâ exasperated.

âAnd then besides,â sez I to myself, out loud, âthereâs Horace. Like
as not he wouldnât allow you to run your head into danger any more.â

âWhat!â yelled The. âDidnât we run our heads into danger all over the
tropics of the Orient, didnât we goad up danger anâ search for it and
roust it out of its hidinâ places andâWhy, confound youââ

In about ten minutes I stopped him, anâ sez in a quiet voice: âWell,
then, if I was you, Iâd go on down to Ty Jonesâs and take on with him
again.â

We lay on the grass there, along Pearl Crick for some time without
speakinâ. Up on the rim, the grass was burned to a crisp; but along
the crick it was still green. Promotheus pulled blade after blade of
it and chewed âem up in his mouth, while me anâ Tank watched him.

âWhat you mean, is for me to take on with Ty Jonesâand then to act
spy on him. Ainât that what ya mean?â sez The after a time.

Iâd âaâ sooner he hadnât put it into wordsâit did look rather raw
when he stood it up before us naked. âI donât mean nothinâ in
particular, The,â sez I. âYou and I are different, and what I could do
without feelinâââ

âThatâs all right,â he broke in. âTheâ ainât any need to treat me like
an infant baby. Come right out with itâWhat you want me to do is to
play spy, ainât it?â

âThatâs the only way I can see to help the Friar,â sez I; âbut he
wouldnât want you to do anything for him you didnât feel was right.â

âI know, I know,â he sez, lookinâ down at his hands. âTy Jones is as
mean as a snake, and I donât deny it; but heâs been square with me,
and once he saved my life. Then again, the Friar has been square with
every one, and if he hadnât nursed me night and day, Horace wouldnât
have had a chance to save my life. If Horace had killed me it would
have spoiled his life; so that the whole thing is held together in a
tangle. Iâm willinâ to cash in my life for the Friarâit ainât
thatâbut I do hate to turn againâ Ty Jones underhanded.â

âBetter just forget I mentioned it,â sez I.

âNo,â sez Promotheus, âI intend to lay the plan before Horace, and let
him settle on it.â

âThatâs a good scheme, thatâs the best way out of it,â sez olâ Tank,
and I joined in with him.

We sat there on the bank a long time, thinkinâ the thing over, and
finally just before supper, Horace hove in sight and started to josh
us; but when he saw how sober we were, he settled down, and asked us
what was up.

âHorace,â sez The, âwhat would you think of my takinâ on with Ty
Jones, and playinâ the spy on him?â

âThat would be madness!â exclaimed Horace. âHeâd see through it and
kill you first pop. I donât know thoughâyou might fix up a taleâbut
then it would be too infernal risky. Nope, donât you try it.â

âIf it could be done,â persisted The, âwhat would you think of it?â

âOh, it would be a great thing for the Friar,â sez Horace; âbut,
Promotheus, I donât like to have you take the risk.â

âIt ainât the risk Iâm fussinâ about,â sez The. âTy was square to me
in his own way. The Friar has been square to me also, and I know âat
his way is the best; but at the same timeâdonât you think it would be
downright snakish for me to go back to Ty, tell him some excuse for my
stayinâ away, and then plot againâ him while Iâm eatinâ his vittles?â

It didnât sound good to us when Promotheus came out with it so
everlastinâ unpolluted; but he had worked up a sense of honesty since
beinâ with Horace, which wouldnât let him do any pertendinâ. Horace
didnât answer, and he went on after waitinâ a minute: âI havenât any
prejudices againâ fightinâ him in the open; but it does go againâ my
grain to wear a dog hide when Iâm playinâ wolf, and Ty Jones was
square to me.â

âWell,â sez Horace, âI havenât the heart to advise you to do this,
Promotheus. Weâll sure be able to find some other way, and as long as
it goes againâ your grain the way it does, I donât want you to do it.â

âWould you think any the less of me if I did?â asked The, his eyes
takinâ on a sad, hungry look, like a dogâs eyes get when heâs worried
over what his masterâll say about some trick heâs been up to.

âCourse I wouldnât think any less of ya,â sez Horace without
hesitatinâ; âbut hang it, Iâm afraid somethinâ âll happen to ya.â

âWould the Friar think any the less of me?â sez The.

âIf the Friar heard about it, he wouldnât let ya go,â sez Horace.

âIâve puzzled more about the Friar ân about airy other man I ever
saw,â sez The, thoughtful. âI wanted to lynch Olaf that time, guilty
or not guilty; but the Friar straightened things out by riskinâ his
own soul. He hates lynchinâ, it goes square againâ his grain; but he
made a bet with us to help stretch Olaf if we could prove him guilty;
and this has stuck with me. This was a big thing to do, and Iâd like
to do somethinâ big for the FriarâBut I swear it would hurt me to spy
on Ty Jones!â

We didnât have anything to say on the subject; so we just sat and
chewed grass.

âIâve been thinkinâ about that old Greek feller, âat you named me
after,â sez Promotheus at last. âHe didnât ask no one else to take the
responsibility of tellinâ him what to do. He just decided what was
right, and then did it. If I go to Ty Jones, and he treats me right,
my own thoughtsâll tear at me like vultures; but this here other
Promotheus, he stood it, âcause it was for manâs good; and Iâm game to
do the same.

âI donât intend to be any more sneakier ân I have to be. All I intend
to do is to find out what I can about the woman, and, if Ty ainât
treatinâ her right, to help get her away from him; but I want it
understood right now that Iâm not goinâ to work any tricks on Ty to
get him into the law for what heâs done in bygone days. Now then, I
take all the blame on my own shoulders; but weâll have to fix up a
tale to fool a wise one, âcause Ty wonât be took in by chaff.â

We talked things over a long time; but it seemed mighty unreasonable
for Promotheus to have pulled out without sayinâ a word, and then to
come back without writinâ in the meantime; and we couldnât quite hit
on it. Finally the idee came to me.

âTheyâre goinâ to graze the grass down to the roots, this summer,â sez
I; âbut still, theâ wonât be enough to go around. A lot oâ cattle will
have to be sold off early, and some will be trailed up into Montana,
and cow-punchers are goinâ to be in demand. Ty is long on cattle and
short on grass, and heâll be glad to have extra help he can trust; so
he wonât question ya too close. You tell him âat Horace here was a
government agent, and that he arrested you as a deserter, and took you
to prison where you was given a life sentence; that you broke out a
couple oâ months ago, and have been workinâ your way back as cautious
as you could.â

âMy Lord, I hate to tell him that!â sez The. âItâs too infernal much
like what I told him the first time.â

âYou got to make up a good story, or else give up your plan,â sez I.

âYes, thatâs so,â he agreed. âTyâd believe that, too. What prison had
I better say Iâve been in?â

âWhich one was you in?â sez I.

âI never was in any government prison,â sez he. âI was in a state
prison.â

âHave ya ever seen a government prison?â sez I.

âYes, Iâve seen two, one in Kansas, and one in Frisco,â sez he.

âWhich would be the hardest to get out of?â sez I.

âThe one in Frisco; itâs on an island,â sez he.

âChoose that one,â sez I; âand make up your escape just as it might
have happened.â

âTy wonât haggle me with questions,â sez The sadly. âHeâll just
believe me, anâ thisâll make it ten times as hard.â

âYou ought to be paler anâ more haggard,â sez I; âbut I doubt if theâs
a way to do it.â

âKeep soakinâ his face in hot towels for a few days,â sez Horace.
âThatâll bleach him out.â

âAre ya goinâ foot or hossback?â sez I.

âI stole a hoss down in Texas the last time I came,â sez he, âand
traded him off when he got footsore.â

âWe got some hosses with a Nevada brand, over at the Dot,â sez I.
âIâll slip over anâ get one while youâre havinâ your complexion
bleached off. They broke out anâ got with the herd before we finished
brandinâ âem, and we just let it go. The chances are they havenât been
rebranded yet.â

âAll right,â sez The. âIf Iâm to do it at all, I want it to go
through; but I have an idee âat those vultures pickinâ at my liver are
goinâ to be mighty unpleasant company.â

Me anâ Spider Kelley, Tillte Dutch anâ Mexican Slim rode over to the
Dot and found two oâ those Nevada hosses, still ranginâ with their old
brands untouched; so we roped one, and came back with it, without
havinâ word with any of the outfit. The Diamond Dot range was the best
of any we rode over, and they had put up a lot oâ hay that summer; but
still I felt sure âat they would have to cut down purty close, though
I knew âat Jabez would hold as many as he could for a high price the
followinâ year.

We found Theâs complexion purty well stewed out and haggard, Kit
havinâ put soda in the hot water; so I told him to play sick, and loaf
around the house as long as possible. He agreed to it; but theâ was a
settled look oâ regret in his face which was a heap different from the
one he had wore when he dismounted from the stage at Bosco.

âNight and day,â sez I, âtheâll be at least two of us at the look-out,
and you come up with any news you have. Get into the habit of
whistlinâ Horaceâs tune; so that if ever youâd want to warn us to
vamose rapid, you can whistle it. You might ride that way with some oâ
Tyâs outfit, or somethinâ.â

âItâs not likely,â sez he. âTheâs no range up that way, and no trail
leadinâ near it; but you fellers want to scatter your tracks all you
can, so as not to make a path.â

We made plans for all the unexpected details we could think up; and
then he started forth one night, meaninâ to circle to the southwest,
and come in from that direction. He wore a red handkerchief under his
nose as if to shut out the dust; but shaved clean, and pale as he was,
mighty few would have recognized him either as Badger-face, or as the
feller what had come in with us a few weeks before. We all shook hands
solemn when he left, and promised to be at the look-out the followinâ
night, and to be there steady from that on.

âWhat makes you fellers trust me?â sez he just as he started. âI came
down here to put Olaf out oâ business, and then I turned over to your
side. Now Iâm goinâ back to Tyâs. What makes you think I wonât turn
againâ ya, if I get into a tight place?â

Horace went over and took his hand. âPromotheus,â sez he, âIâve been
with you through hot days and cold nights, Iâve been with you through
hunger and thirst and danger; and Iâd trust you as long as Iâd trust
myself. Youâre not goinâ to Tyâs because youâre a traitor. Youâre
goinâ because youâre a changed man, and the new man youâve become is
willinâ to risk his life for what he thinks is right. No matter what
happens, Iâll trust ya; so take that along to think over.â

Promotheus winked his eyes purty fast, then he gave a sigh and rode
off into the night. Theâ wasnât the hint of a smile about his lips,
nor a glint oâ gladness in his eyes; but somethinâ in the straight way
âat he held his back let ya know âat the inside man of him was finally
at peace with what the outside man was doinââand if ya donât know
what that means, theâs no way to tell ya.




CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE

THE FRIAR A COMPLICATION


We all felt purty down-hearted after Promotheus had rode away, and we
sat before the fire in Olafâs settinâ room a good deal the same as if
we were holdinâ a wake.

âOlaf,â I sez, âyou canât have any finicky notions about treatinâ Ty
Jones square, after all the persecutinâ heâs handed you. Do you know
anything on him you could have him sent to prison for?â

Olaf shook his head. âHeâs too clever to get caught in a trap,â sez
he. âHe scarcely ever gave any orders to have things done. Heâd just
say aloud as though talkinâ to himself, that some one or other was in
his way; and then his men would begin to take spite on that feller. If
the calf tally showed a hundred percent increase, he would think that
about right, and no questions; but if ever it fell short oâ what he
expected, we had it to make up some way. Heâd send us out until we had
brought in enough to satisfy; but heâd never give us straight orders
to rustle. He is a smart man. When one of his men got into trouble, he
got him out, no matter what cost; but he expected his men to do what
he wanted, without askinâ questions. He has no fear, none at all. I
know, I have seen. He has no fear, and he is very strong. It is bad to
be at war with him; but I should like to have my hands at his throat
once, and none to interfere.â

âMaybe you will, Olaf,â sez I, âmaybe you will; and I donât mind
sayinâ that I hope to be on hand to see it.â

We kept two men allus at the look-out with Horaceâs field glasses. It
was a queer sort oâ summer, the air wasnât clear like it usually is,
but hazy, as though full oâ dust; and in lots of places they were
turninâ stock on the grass they generally aimed to save for winter.
There were only a few punchers around the Cross brand ranch houses;
but we saw Promotheus every day. He hobbled about with a stick part oâ
the time, holdinâ his hand on his back as though he had the rheumatiz,
which was natural enough from beinâ shut up in an island prison. Some
days we saw the woman; but she never came up the ravine path any more.

Promotheus didnât make a report to us for about a week. Then he came
out one night about eleven. He said âat Ty hadnât doubted a word heâd
said; but had done everything possible to make him comfortable,
tellinâ him to just loaf until he got in good order. He said âat Ty
and the woman didnât have much to do with each other and hadnât had
since sheâd come out. He said âat the woman was kind to all the
animals, in spite of everything âat Ty could do, and the dogs was
gettinâ to act like regular, ordinary dogs. He said all but a few new
pups had remembered him, and one had even wagged his tail, though he
couldnât see any sense in this, he never havinâ as much as spoke a
kind word to the dog, so far as he could recollect.

He said he had held several talks with Ty, and Ty had asked him if he
thought âat Olaf was in league with any big outfits. He said âat he
had told Ty that he was sure Olaf had been in league with âem several
years before, but oâ course, he couldnât know anything oâ what had
happened since. Ty said he had come to the conclusion that Olaf was
set out for a kind of bait to draw him into trouble, which was why he
had let him alone; but that he was short oâ grass this season, and
wanted Pearl Crick Spread bad. He also told The about the two Greasers
disappearinâ, though he wasnât sure what had happened to âem. He knew
about us beinâ over at Olafâs off and on, and The warned us to be
careful, as Ty expected to have Olafâs place watched as soon as he got
through movinâ several bands oâ cattle.

The said âat the woman had a soft spot for any dumb brute, or even a
human in distress, and that he had touched her by hobblinâ around with
the stick. He said she had cooked him some flabby invalid-food with
her own hands, and that it was mighty captivatinâ. He said she didnât
speak much; but he was tryinâ his best to get on the good side of her.
He said âat all the boys claimed âat Ty treated her well; but didnât
seem to care much for her. Horace didnât happen to be with us when The
came; but we said weâd move our camp higher up on the slope, to be on
the safe side when Olafâs was watched, and would have Horace on deck
sure the next time The came out; and we did this the next day.

The land was all slashed anâ twisted around and broken, up west oâ the
Cross brand ranch houses. The ravine leadinâ down to âem ran east and
west, the path leadinâ up out of it to the trees where we had first
seen the woman wasnât near so steep as the one cominâ out of it on the
north side toward the clump oâ rocks. After the north path came out,
the ravine narrowed down until it wasnât more than a crack, the south
side not risinâ so high as on the north; so that soon the north side
stood up like a cliff above the land leadinâ down to the clump of
trees, and the only way we could get over to it was to go down the
ravine and up again on the other side.

We made our camp considâable higher than our look-out had been, and it
was a well sheltered spot. An easy slopinâ stretch led up to it from
the north, and a ledge skirted the face oâ the cliff up back of it, to
the south. We examined this some distance; but it didnât seem to lead
anywhere. We found several dips back in the hills where the snow water
made grazinâ for our ponies, and we were as comfortable as itâs ever
possible to be while waitinâ.

I know what my plan would be for makinâ a hell which would be
punishment for any mortal sin, and yet not severe enough to make me
hate all the peace out oâ my own existence. Iâd make the wicked sit in
the dark for a hundred years, waitinâ to hear what their sentence was.
Then, Iâd let âem into heaven, and I bet they would be in a fair way
to appreciate it. I never met up with any one able to out-wait me
without showinâ it more ân I did; but Iâll wager what I got, that the
suspense was gorinâ into me worse ân into them, all the time.

One eveninâ, me anâ Tank went up to camp after doinâ our stunt at the
look-out, and as we went, we caught sight oâ two riders headinâ our
way. We hastened along so as to be ready to move in case this was a
pair we didnât care to draw to; but by the time we reached camp, they
were close enough to recognize as the Friar and Olaf. The plan was to
keep the Friar in the dark as long as possible, and we waited their
cominâ with considâable interest.

The Friar had squeezed the whole thing out of Olaf, as we might have
known he would. You couldnât trust Olaf with a secret where the Friar
was concerned. Tank, now, would have sent the Friar off to Bosco or
Laramie as contented as a bug; but just as soon as Olaf was backed
into a corner, he told the truth, and spoiled all our arrangements.

The Friar rode into our camp, dismounted, threw his reins to the
ground, and sez: âWhere is Promotheus?â

We looked at Olaf, and he nodded his head as sheepish as the under dog
at a bee-swarminâ. âHeâs down at the ranch,â sez Horace.

âHas he brought any news?â asked the Friar. So we told him all âat The
had reported. He took a few steps up and down, ponderinâ.

âI canât permit this,â he said after a minute. âHe is riskinâ his life
down there, and I canât allow him to continue.â

The rest all joined in and argued with him; but he was as obstinate as
a burro, once he got his back up; so I didnât say anything. I went off
and started to eat my supper. When I was about half through, Horace
came over and said the Friar was bent on goinâ down to Tyâs himself.
âWell, let him go,â sez I as cool as a snow-slide.

âYes, but if he goes, Ty will kill both him and Promotheus!â sez
Horace raisinâ his voice. I noticed the others headinâ toward us so I
only flung my hands into the air, meaninâ that it was none oâ my
business.

âDo you mean to say âat you back the Friar up in this?â demanded
Horace.

âDo I look like a fool?â sez I. The Friarâs eyes were on me, and I
knew they were cold; but I pertended not to notice him.

âYou donât look like a fool; but you act like one,â sez Horace,
gettinâ riled.

âYou canât blame me, Horace,â I sez in my most drawly voice, âbecause
the Friar cares more for havinâ his own way than he does for human
life.â

âWhat do you mean by that?â demanded the Friar.

âOh, nothinâ,â sez I, âexcept that if you go down there, it shows
Prometheus up at once, weâd all have to go along to save Promotheus,
and this would start a fight, with us to blame; and no one knowinâ
what the woman is, or how she stands in the matter. She seems
perfectly satisfied with Ty Jones; and no matter how it turned out,
all of us who survived would have to leave the country. I donât intend
to argue with you, or to cross you in any way; but I do intend to
stand by Promotheus, as it was me who first put the idee into his
head.â

I sympathized with the Friar, I knew that he wasnât himself. To find
the woman he loved in the hands of the man who hated him, after all
the years he had been in suspense about her was enough to tip any one
off his balance; and I also knew the Friar. He had trained himself for
eternity so long that some of his earthly idees werenât sound, and the
surest way to bring him to himself was to let him bark his knees a
time or two. Some imported hosses carry their gaze so high they canât
see their footinâ but after theyâve stepped into a few prairie-dog
holes, they learn to take a little more interest in what theyâre
treadinâ on.

The Friar came over and looked down at me. âI shall wait until
Promotheus comes up here, and then he can stay; and I shall go down,â
said the Friar in the voice a man uses when he thinks itâs wrong to
show the sarcasm he canât help but feel. âHave you any objection to
this?â

âI have no objection to anything you choose to do, Friar,â I said,
finishinâ my supper.

âDo I understand that you approve?â sez he.

âCertainlee not,â sez I. âTy would see the connection between you and
Promotheus at once. He knows âat The was a deserter, and he would set
the law on him in one direction, and try to run him down on his own
hook in the other. If you had been on hand while we were discussinâ
the plan, you would have had the right to veto it; but now, it looks
to me as though Prometheus was the one to consider.â

The Friar sat down and ran his hands through his hair. âI canât see
any way out!â he sez at last; âbut Iâm forced to admit that since
Promotheus has gone down there, it would put him in danger for me to
interfere.â

âWell,â sez olâ Tank, âhere is The himself. Now, weâll know better
what to do.â

We looked up, and there was Promotheus with a bruise over his eye,
cominâ into our little nook.




CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

A SIDE-TRIP TO SKELTYâS


We all crowded around him, thinkinâ âat the bruise betokened some sort
of trouble; but he said heâd got afraid theyâd begin to suspicion him;
so he had tried to ride a hoss that day, and had let it buck him off.
He said theâ wasnât much lettinâ needed, as it had been a mean one;
but he had got his forehead grazed, and had lain on the ground,
claiminâ his back was hurt. It was only about eight oâclock, and we
wondered how he had the nerve to come so early; but he said they were
havinâ a drinkinâ bout over havinâ dogged a feller by the name oâ
Bryce off his claim on Ice Crick, thus gettinâ a new outlet to grass
and water.

He said the woman had been mighty good to him after his fall; but that
he couldnât get her to talk about herself at all. âHave you ever
mentioned the name of Carmichael to her?â I asked.

âNo,â sez he, âwhy should I?â

âThatâs the Friarâs name,â sez I. âHe used to preach in a regular
church down east, and she sang in the choir. Next time you get a
chance, try to draw her out about this.â

The Friar told him a lot oâ small details to ask her about; and went
part way back with him, as he wouldnât stay long for fear oâ beinâ
missed. The Friar insisted on stayinâ along with us, while Olaf went
back to the Spread.

Two nights after this Promotheus came up to our camp again. He said he
had had several talks with her, and that she remembered the names and
places, all right, but insisted that Carmichael was dead. She said he
often came to her in her dreams; but that she knew he had died long
ago.

âDoes she ever sing?â asked the Friar.

âNever,â sez The. âShe donât even talk much. She has some sort of a
pain in her head, and sometimes she seems to wander; but at other
times she is perfectly clear.â

âIs Ty Jones ever mean to her?â asked the Friar.

âNever,â sez The. âTy ainât mean to those about him. He has his own
ideesâhe likes to have his men and dogs and hosses all fierce and
nervyâbut heâs not mean to âem. And all the boys treat her
respectful, too. Fact is, I donât see where we got any grounds to take
her away.â

âBut she does not care for him,â sez the Friar; âshe could not care
for him! He must have used trick or force to bring her here; and you
must find out the truth about it. It all depends on you, now.â

âIâm doinâ all I can, Friar,â sez The; âbut itâs a hard tangle to see
through.â

When he left to go back, me anâ the Friar and Horace went with him.
âSupposinâ they should see you cominâ back?â sez the Friar.

âWell,â sez The, âTy donât keep his men in prison, and Iâd tell âem I
was up takinâ a little air after beinâ shut away from it so long.â

âSupposinâ they got suspicious anâ follered ya?â asked the Friar.

âI try to be as careful as I can,â sez The; âbut I own up I allus feel
a bit nervous till I get back to my bunk.â

âThe best plan is for one of us to wait where the path leads down into
the ravine each night at eleven,â sez the Friar. âWe could go at ten
and wait until twelve. If we went any closer, the dogs might get scent
of us.â

We agreed âat this would be the best plan; and after this, two of us
made it a point to spend a couple of hours waitinâ there, while the
rest stayed at the look-out ready to hustle down if theâ was any
excitement; but nothinâ happened and we got purty fidgetty.

âTank,â sez I one afternoon, âletâs ride over to Skeltyâs. Theâs
generally some Cross-branders there, and perhaps we can find a little
amusement.â

We reached there about seven, and ordered supper. There were five
Cross-branders there already, eatinâ and drinkinâ; and one of âem was
the tall feller by the name oâ Dixon. I nodded to him when I sat down
and he nodded back. Itâs funny the way a man feels when he goes into
an unfriendly place to measure anâ be measured. Itâs not like fear,
that is, not like panicky fear; but still I suppose itâs something
like what a jack-rabbit feels when the hounds are strung out after
him. He knows well enough whatâll happen if he canât run fast
enoughâbut then he takes a heap of exhilaration in the thought that
he most certainly can run fast enough.

All those fellers knew something oâ me anâ olâ Tank; while Dixon was
the only one we knew, the rest beinâ mostly young chaps who had taken
on with Ty durinâ the last few years; but as most oâ Tyâs men were
trailed out oâ some other state by a posse, it was a safe bet that
they had more or less rattler blood in âem. They were all on friendly
terms with the girls, and the girls called âem by name, whenever they
couldnât think up some other term âat suited their taste better. One
oâ these young fellers still had a boyâs eyes; but most oâ their eyes
were purty hard anâ chilly.

I never did set any store on havinâ a strange woman call me âdearâ;
and neither did olâ Tank. With his eye runninâ wild, and his mussed-up
features, the term dear fitted him about as snug as false bangs anâ
face-powder would; but one oâ these young hussies came over anâ stood
behind his chair, and sez: âWhy hello, dearie, where have you been all
the time?â

âIâve been over teachinâ my grandchildren how to play the pianer,â sez
Tank. âHave you got any pork anâ beans?â

Most any girl knows âat most any manâll stand for most anything; so
this one grabbed hold oâ Tankâs hair and gave it a pull; but she
savvied âat he didnât have any love for her, so she brought in his
grub, threw it down in front of him, and went back to soft-soapinâ the
feller with a boyâs eyes. He was still young enough to feel flattered
by it, and truth to tell, she wasnât a bad lookinâ girl, except that
she drenched a feller so constant with her feminine charms that she
washed away any hankerinâs for âem he might have had to begin with.

Any healthy woman has all the allurement she can possibly need, if
sheâll just take care of it. I like to see a hoss full oâ fire, and I
like to see a woman full of enticement; but I like to see both the
fire anâ the enticement kept under good control, and not made to show
out unnecessary.

Once, when I was in Frisco, I saw a parade of the Friendly Order of
Hindu Cats, and the Grand Thomas Cat oâ Creation rode in front on an
old gray hoss. This hoss had feet like worn-out brooms, and theâ was
knots all over his legs. All he asked in the way of entertainment was
to pass a peaceful day in a quiet stable, face to face with a bale of
hay; but they had clipped his mane anâ tail, hung a beaded belt across
his brisket, put a scarlet blanket on him, and jabbed him with spurs
until he was irritated to a degree.

The feller ridinâ him had learned to ride in a barberâs chair; but he
had a heavy frown, and a lot oâ gold lace, and a big canoe-shaped hat;
and I have to admit that if they had tied him fast to the saddle, and
put rubber spurs on him, he would have looked the part like a picture.
Every time heâd see one of his friends heâd stab the hoss on the off
side, then jerk back on the curb, and smile benevolent, as though he
intended to save the populace from that fiery steed or sprain every
bone in his face.

The old gray was as forgivinâ a hoss as I ever see; but he had his
limits as well as the rest of us. For the first ten or fifteen blocks,
heâd only swish his tail and prance when his rider jabbed him an order
for a little more fire; but finally his flanks got touchy, and his
sense oâ justice began to write the declaration of independence on his
patience. This would have been the time an intelligent human would
have traded off his spurs for an apple or a lump oâ sugar, or some
other welcome little peace-offerinâ; but just then the parade passed
under a window jammed full oâ the Grand Thomas Catâs closest friends,
and oâ course, they had to see a little fire.

He straightened out his legs, and then clamped the spurs into the old
grayâs flanks. I had fought my way through the crowd for fifteen
squares just to see it happen, and it was well worth it. The gray was
stiff and awkward, but in his youth he had taken a few lessons in
buckinâ, and what he lacked in speed and practice, he made up in
earnestness. The Thomas Cat didnât know any more about balancing than
a ball, and the grip of his knees wouldnât have put a dent in a
pulletâs egg; theâ was no horn to the saddle, and the mane had been
clipped, so all he had to hang on with was the spurs and the curb bit;
and things certainly did happen.

The old gray pitched and kicked and reared and backed and snorted and
got mixed up with flags and citizens and umbrellas and red-lemonade
stands and policemen; until finally he scraped off the Grand Thomas
Cat of Creation on an awning, and tore off home, jumpinâ and kickinâ;
while the population threw their hats in the air and yelled their
palates loose. They threw fruit and popcorn and friendly advice at the
Grand Cat as he hung from the awning; but friend or foe, theâ wasnât a
soul in that crowd to help him get down; so as soon as he got calm
enough to remember what he was, he dropped the three feet to the
sidewalk, and ran into the store and hid.

If ya want to fill a crowd with content and satisfaction and joy and
felicity and such-like items, just have some terrible accident happen
to a popular hero, and all the joy-wellsâll overflow and gush forth
like fountainsâBut what made me think oâ this little incident was the
fact that this girl at Skeltyâs put the spurs to her feminine charms a
leetle too continuous.

Dixon, the Cross-brander, was one oâ these lean, skinny ones, and as a
rule, I donât crave to make their acquaintance. His Adamâs apple ran
up and down in his neck like a dumbwaiter, and theâ was plenty oâ
distance for considâable of a run. If ya looked at just the part of
him between his chin and his shoulders, he resembled an ostrich,
chokinâ on an orange; but I decided to be as friendly as possible; so
as soon as Iâd filled a cigarette paper, I offered him my sack oâ
tobacco. He took it, and while he was rollinâ himself a cigarette, he
sez: âI see youâve cut loose from your preacher.â

âNope,â sez I, âhe cut loose from me.â

âHow come you fellers spend so much time out this way?â sez he.

âNice country and pleasant folks,â sez I.

âIâve heard tell âat you got so familiar over at the Diamond Dot, that
the old man turned ya loose,â sez he. âIs theâ anything to it?â

I didnât reply at once. My first impulse was to see if I couldnât pull
him and his Adamâs apple apart; for this wasnât no accident. This was
a studied insult, and every one there was watchinâ to see what would
happen; but theâ was too much at stake; so I gripped myself until I
had time to put that remark where it wouldnât run any risk oâ
spoilinâ; and then I sez: âWell, I donât just like to have it put that
way; but I will admit that you havenât missed it so terrible far.â

âLookinâ for a job?â sez he.

âOh, Iâm not carinâ much,â sez I. âIâm thinkinâ some oâ takinâ a
homestead, or buyinâ some other feller out; but I ainât in any hurry.
I may go on down into Texas, or take on again up here. Any chance for
a job with your outfit?â

Durinâ the time I had been decidinâ on what Iâd say, Dixon had been
wonderinâ how Iâd take it; and I donât doubt he was some relieved.
Anyway, he thawed out a little. âNope, I hardly think so,â sez he.
âWeâve been hard pushed for grass this season; but Ty bought a
water-right on Ice Crick, and things has smoothed out again. Another
thing is, that Badger-face has come back.â

I gave a start as natural as life, and I didnât put it on, neither. I
had no idy heâd mention Badger-face without a lot oâ pumpinâ.
âBadger-face?â sez I. âGood Lord, I thought he was dead!â

âWell, we thought so, too,â sez Dixon. âWe hadnât heard a word from
him; but he showed up a while back, and as soon as he gets able, heâll
take to ridinâ again.â

âWhatâs wrong with him?â sez I.

âHeâs purty well played out,â sez Dixon. âHe sez âat that feller,
Bradford, is some sort of a government agent. Now, we ainât got
nothinâ againâ the government out this way, so long as it minds its
own business; but when it gets to interferinâ with our rights, why it
generally has to find a new agent. You were along with this feller,
Bradford, when he scooped in Badger-face; and I doubt if that has
slipped Badgerâs mind yet. Badgerâs memory for such things used to be
purty reliable.â

âWell, if it comes to that,â sez I, âIâd rather have Badger-face on my
trail than Dinky Bradford; though I own up, I donât just know what
government position Dinky holds.â

âOlâ man Williams there was along with ya, too, wasnât he?â sez Dixon.

âSure he was,â sez I. âWe got a heap better paid, for that trip ân we
usually get.â

âYes,â sez he, slow anâ drawly, âbut a feller can never tell when heâs
all paid out for such a trip as that.â

âA feller has to take chances in everything,â sez I. âI still got a
little money left to amuse myself with.â

âIt donât seem to make ya reckless,â sez he. Dixon had been drinkinâ
purty freely, and I rather liked the effect liquor had on him.

âMaxwell,â I called, âthis is a dry summer. Set up the drinks for the
house.â Some saloon-keepers fawn on ya as if theyâd melt the money out
oâ your clothes while some of âem are cold and haughty, as though it
was an insult to offer âem money. Maxwell was one oâ this kind. He
glared his red eyes at me as if Iâd been rude; but he set out the
drinks all right.

Tank had been shut away from drink for so long that I had plumb forgot
how he had happened to win his title; but as soon as I had give the
order, I sensed that he was in the mood to sluice himself out
thorough. The very minute we had cooled off from the drinksâMaxwell
kept a brand oâ poison which would eat holes in an iron kettle, if you
let it set five minutesâWell, the very instant the steam had stopped
cominâ out of our mouths, Tank ordered a round; and before that had
got on good terms with the first drink, Spider Kelley had arrived.

Mexican Slim had guessed where we were headinâ for, and Tank had owned
up to it, and Slim had told Spider, and, oâ course, Spider hadnât been
able to stay behind; so when he stuck his nose in the door, Tank sez
âat the drinks was always on the last-comer, and Spider ordered a
round.

I can journey about with a fair amount oâ booze, without lettinâ it
splash over into my conversation; but I was there on business, so I
drank as short drinks as would seem sociable. Tank, on the other hand,
had formerly been as immune to liquor as a glass bottle; but he was
out oâ practice without realizinâ it; and he splashed into Maxwellâs
forty-rod as though he was a trout hurryinâ back to his native
element. Spider was a wise old rat, and he played safe, the same as
me. Oâ course, the Cross-branders couldnât stand by and see us
purchase Maxwellâs entire stock, without makinâ a few bids themselves;
so for a while, we peered at the ceiling purty tolâable frequent.

The young feller with the boyâs eyes was chin-ful to begin with, the
other three Cross-branders were purty well calloused to a liberal
supply oâ turpentine; while Dixon would load up his dumb-waiter and
send it down as unconcerned as though his throat was a lead pipe,
connectinâ with an irrigation ditch. He had reached the stage where he
was reckless but not thoughtless, and theâ didnât seem any way to wash
him down grade any farther.

âAny more oâ you fellers liable to drop in?â sez he, lookinâ at me. I
waved my hand towards Spider, as though he, beinâ the last to arrive,
would have the latest news; and Spider sez: âNope, I reckon not.
Leastwise, not so far as I know.â

âBadger-face has come back and taken on with Ty again,â sez I.

âThe hell he has!â exclaimed Spider, just as I knew he would.

âYes,â sez Dixon with an evil chuckle, âheâs come back, and I doubt if
heâd feel any sorrow at meetinâ up with some oâ you boys.â

âAs far as I remember,â sez olâ Tank, bulkinâ up as ponderous as a
justice oâ the peace, âI donât recall havinâ asked Badgerâs permission
to do anything in the past, and I donât intend to begin now.â

âWell,â sez Dixon, âI donât mind tellinâ ya that Ty Jones ainât so
sure oâ Badger as he used to be; and nothinâ would suit him so well as
to see Badger cut loose and get some oâ you fellers for helpinâ to
have him railroaded.â

This surprised me. Dixon didnât seem a shade worse ân heâd been when
Spider arrived, but heâd sure enough leaked out the news I was after.
Ty was suspicious oâ Promotheus, and weâd have to finish our job as
soon as possible. I didnât want to start anything at Skeltyâs so I
proposed a little friendly poker. The Kid was asleep in the corner; so
the seven of us played stud for an hour or so until Tank fell out of
his chair, and then we broke up for the night.

Tank was all in; so we had to put him to bed, and the Kid had to be
put to bed, also; but Dixon and the other three took a final drink and
started back to Tyâs.




CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN

PROMOTHEUS IN THE TOILS


Tank weighed like a beef when he got liquor-loose, and it was all me
and Spider could do to get him to bed. His legs were like rubber; but
he insisted on tellinâ us what he thought about things. He begged us
to start back and let him ride, sayinâ that it was only the heat oâ
the room, not the drink, which had upset him; but he was in no shape
to ride a hay wagon, so we put him to bed.

âI think more oâ the Friar than of airy other man I know,â he sez to
us at the head oâ the stairs; âbut I own up âat I donât take kindly to
religion; and Iâll tell ya why. Theâs hundreds anâ dozens of hymns to
the doggone sheep-herders; but theâ ainât one single one to the
cow-punchers. Now, what I sez is this, if ya want to round me up in a
religion, you got to find one âat has hymns to cattle men.â

We didnât bother to explain it to him, âcause he wasnât in condition
to know a parable from a pair oâ boots. We dragged him along the hall
and flung him on his bed. By chance we put him on the bed with his
boots on the piller; but he went sound asleep the moment he stretched
out; so we just hung his hat on his toe, folded the blanket over him,
locked the door, put the key in my pocket, and went across the hall to
our own room.

I didnât want to harbor that liquor any longer ân I had to, so me anâ
Spider slipped down, got some salt anâ mustard, soaked it in water,
drenched ourselvesâand repented of havinâ been such fools. Then we
went up to bed. It had been some time since we had stretched out on
springs, and we were cordial for sleep; so we mingled with it in short
order.

Still, I wasnât easy in my mind, and twice I woke up and went into the
hall; but I couldnât hear anything, though I had a feelinâ that theâd
been some good cause for my wakinâ up. I lay on the bed the last time
with my mind made up to watch. Skeltyâs had allus had the name oâ
beinâ a tough joint, and this red-eyed Maxwell with his Injun hair
wasnât of the kind to purify it to such an extent that the old
customers wouldnât feel at home.

As I lay there, I saw the window rise, slow and careful. Theâ wasnât
any moon; but I could see a hand in the starlight. I made up my mind
to sneak out oâ bed, grab the hand, pull it in to the shoulder, and
then throw all my weight on it, and yell for Spider. I got up as
noiseless as cider turninâ into vinegarâand then upset a confounded
chair, which sounded like two houses runninâ together.

The window dropped with a bang; and at the same moment theâ came a
shriek from across the hall, followed by some scufflinâ and the sound
oâ broken glass. After this all we heard was Tankâs voice tryinâ to
explain his opinion oâ that part oâ the country and all its
inhabitants. I had thought that Tank had discarded most of his
profanity; but by the time we had got our guns and crossed the hall to
him, I changed my mind. When I put the key in the lock, he suggested
to us what was likely to happen to any unfriendly individuals who
attempted to enter that particular room.

I told him gently to stuff the piller into his mouth, if he couldnât
find any other way to stop his yappinâ; and then I unlocked the door,
just as Maxwell and his bartender came into the hall. The bartender
had one gun and one candle, and Maxwell had two guns.

When we opened the door, there was Tank with the blood runninâ down
his leg, while he stood in a corner of the room holdinâ his weapon up
above his shoulder. âWhatâs the matter with you?â I sez, a little
cross.

âIâm homesick, you blame ijiot!â sez Tank. âWhat else would likely be
the matter with me?â Tank was about as far out oâ humor as I ever saw
him get.

Maxwell came in and looked at the pool of blood. âDonât stand there
and bleed on the floor,â sez he.

Tank looked at him baleful. âWhat do ya wish me to doâupset your
rotten dive and bleed on the ceilinâ?â sez he. âI didnât come here
determined to smear up your place with my life blood; and I want ya to
understand that I didnât punch this hole in myself simply to cool off.
I know what youâre afraid ofâYouâre scared that some oâ your liquor
has got into my blood, anâ that itâll leak out and set your floor on
fire.â

âYou run get a bucket for him to bleed into,â sez Maxwell to the
bartender.

âYes,â sez Tank, sarcastic; âand be sure to get a big one, as I am
minded to draw off all oâ my blood, just to see how much I have in me
at this time oâ the year.â

Sayinâ which, Tank walked over anâ sittinâ on the bed, held out his
boot for me to pull off. He had been stabbed through the leg, through
the thick part oâ the calf, and a jet was spoutinâ out of the top cut,
and a steady stream oozinâ from the bottom one. I put my finger
knuckle above the top jet, and the palm of my other hand over the
lower one, and then sent Maxwell after a small rope and some bandages.

While he was gone, a couple oâ the girls strolled down the hall to see
what the excitement was; but Tank began to lecture about morals and
manners, and they didnât bother us long. We patched Tank up in good
order, and made him lie down again. He said that he had been woke up
when his leg got stabbed, and had grappled with a man; but the man had
got out the window again.

Skelty had built his place on a side hill. The bar and dininâ hall was
in front, and a small dance hall and kitchen back of it. Upstairs were
bedrooms, and the ground sloped so, that the back rooms were only
about five feet from the ground. This made the downstairs easier to
heat in winterâand it was also convenient for any one who wanted to
get in through a window.

Me and Spider ate breakfast next morninâ; but we wouldnât let Tank
eat, rememberinâ the Friarâs rules for wounds. When we started away,
Tank insisted on goinâ along; so we had to ride slow. We went north,
instead of in the direction we wanted to go, for fear some one might
be spyinâ on us. I was mighty sorry we had come, even though I had
found out that Promotheus was under suspicion; and as soon as we had
come to a pass where we could see a good distance in all directions, I
sent Spider on a circle to tell the boys to bring things to a head as
soon as possible.

Tankâs leg ached him considâable; and we had to ride purty slow; but
by noon we had come to the Simpsonsâ cabin. We told âem that Ty Jones
was suspicious about the Greasers and intended to get square with all
who had took a hand in removinâ âem; so they agreed to stand with us
whenever we were ready to make a raid on Ty.

I made Tank lie down all afternoon, and drink all the water he could
swallow, but that night when I started to ride over to the look-out,
he insisted on goinâ along. It was a hard ride, and I wanted him to
wait until the next night, but he tagged along, so I had to ride slow.
We had figured out that the feller who had tried to get him had seen
the hat on his foot at the head oâ the bed; and before he had had time
to locate him proper, the noise the other one had made slamminâ the
window to my room had scared him, so he had taken his stab haphazard.

This must âaâ been the way, âcause when drinkinâ, Tank was usually a
regular long range snorer, and only a hurried man would have mistaken
his feet for his head. Tank insisted that he had seen the fellerâs
outline againâ the window, and that it had been Dixon. I doubted this;
but Tank insisted that the feller had had a neck like a beer bottle,
and then I had to give in.

We didnât reach camp until sun-up, and then we found âat Promotheus
had been there the night before, with word that he had had a long talk
with the woman, who had been in the most rational mood he had ever
seen her in. He had drawn her into tellinâ him all she could remember.
She had told him about havinâ her head full oâ pictures; but not beinâ
able to tell the real ones from those she had dreamed. She said she
had lost the key to them and could not understand âem, that she
remembered havinâ sung on many different platforms, but could not tell
where or when, and could not sing any more, though she sometimes
tried. She said that whenever he said the name Carmichael, she saw the
picture of a young man in white robes, but that he had died. When
Promotheus had tried to make her understand that he was still alive,
she had become frightened, and told him never to speak the name again.

He asked her about the Winter Garden in Berlin, and she said âat this
called up the picture of a man with curled-up mustaches, and then she
had covered her eyes, and told him he must not mention this again,
either. Horace was tellinâ me all this; and when he finished, I sez:
âWell, if this is the most rational she has ever got, sheâd be a nice
one to handle in her usual condition. I donât see what weâre to do;
but we have to move fast, as Ty Jones is suspicious.â

The next night the Friar and I were down at the head of the path
leadinâ into the ravine when Promotheus came. He said that Dixon had
come in with his face cut, and had told about seeinâ us over at
Skeltyâs, and how we had bragged about gettinâ him rail-roaded, and
Dixon and the others had told him they were ready to back him up any
time he wanted to go anâ get even. He also said âat Ty had been
roastinâ the whole gang of âem for beinâ afraid of Olaf, and advised
us to warn Olaf to be on guard. He said the woman had told him that
day that at all times she had a dull pain in the top part of her head.
The was beginninâ to get worried, this was plain to see, and he didnât
stay very long.

When we told the others what he had said, we decided it was our duty
to go and tell Olaf that very night, so that he could send over the
next day and get a couple oâ the Simpson boys to come over and help
watch his place at night, until we were ready to finish with Ty. We
wanted to put it off as long as possible, as Ty would soon be in the
fall round-up and there wouldnât be so many men at the home place.

Mexican Slim and Tillte Dutch started to ride to Olafâs; but I was
restless that night, so I rode along with âem. Just before we reached
the Spread, we saw a bright light at the side oâ the cabin. In a
minute two other lights shot up, and we knew they were firinâ brush at
the side of it. We threw in the spurs and rode, keepinâ close watch.
Two men rode towards us, and we drew off to the side of the road. Just
as they got opposite, we ordered âem to halt; but they whirled and
fired at us. We fired back, and started after âem; but it was dark in
the cottonwoods, and they gave us the slip and got away.

When we reached the cabin, we saw it was doomed. Piles oâ brush had
been heaped on all sides of it and fired one after the other.
Everything was so dry that even the dirt on the roof would have
burned, and there was nothing to do. Kit with the boy in her arms, and
Olaf and Oscar beside her were standinâ close by, watchinâ it burn,
and they felt mighty bitter. We told âem why we had come, and advised
âem to go and leave Kit with the Simpsons, and come to our camp the
next night. Then we rode back before daylight and told the others what
had happened. We were all purty hosstile. Settinâ fire to a cabin with
a sleepinâ woman inside wasnât no fair way oâ fightinâ.

That afternoon as we were watchinâ the ranch through the field
glasses, we saw the woman and Promotheus walkinâ together toward a
little open space in the cottonwoods where theâ was some grass close
to the edge oâ the crick. Thick bushes was all about this place, and
it was cool and pleasant in the heat oâ the day. They hadnât been gone
very long when we saw two others sneakinâ after them. I looked through
the glasses, and one appeared to be the skinny feller, Dixon, and the
other, the Chinese cook. We saw âem sneak into the bushes and
disappear close to where the woman and Promotheus were sittinâ. Part
oâ the time they talked together, and part of the time she read to him
out of a book.

We fair ached to yell to âem and put âem on their guard; but all we
could do was to sit up above in our look-out, feelinâ weak and
useless. I suppose we felt like a mother bird when she sees some
inhuman human foolinâ about her nest.

After a time the Chink crept out and scurried along to the old house.
He bounced across the porch, all crouched over, and we knew he had
some evil tale to cheer up his yellow soul with. In half a minute, Ty
came out with him and follered him into the clump oâ bushes. We could
see the woman and Promotheus plain, with our naked eyes. It was a good
thing, too; for Horace hung on to his glasses as though they were life
preservers.

In about ten minutes, the bushes parted, and Ty stepped into the open
space in front of âem. Promotheus got to his feet slow, but the woman
sat still, and didnât seem much interested.

Ty glared at Promotheus durinâ the few minutes he was questioninâ him,
and then they all went back towards the ranch house. The woman went on
to her own cabin, and Ty blew on the horn which hung at the side of
the door, and that sneak of a Dixon came on the run, as though he had
no idee what was wanted. Actinâ under orders from Ty, he took Theâs
gun and then tied his hands behind him and shut him up in an out
buildinâ near the stables. There didnât appear to be any one else
about the ranch, and I suggested that we make a rush and take
possession right then.

While we were debatinâ it, we saw the punchers cominâ in from the
east, across the crick. There were about a dozen of âem, strung out
and ridinâ hard the way they generally rode.

âTheyâre likely to string him up this very night,â sez I; âand weâll
have to settle this business before sun-up.â

âThey are not likely to be in any hurry,â sez the Friar. âIf we go
to-night it will mean a lot oâ bloodshed. To-morrow they will go out
on the range again, and we stand a good chance of rescuing him without
even a fight.â

Olaf, of course, sided with the Friar, Horace sided with me, and we
had a purty heated discussion. The Friar argued that he had the most
at stake and had a right to select the plan with the least risk. I
argued that Promotheus had the most at stake, and we had no right to
take risk into account. We got purty excited, I usinâ the word coward
freely, while the Friar stuck to the word folly and kept cooler ân I
did. He finally won âem over to a compromise. We were to go down close
and keep watch durinâ the night; but not to make a rush until we saw
Promotheus actually in instant danger.




CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT

OLAF RUNS THE BLOCKADE


Ty Jones had been as wise as a fox when he located his ranch house. It
sat on high ground, while back of it rose a cliff; so âat the only way
you could get to it without ropes from the back, was through the
little ravine. The cliffs circled around to the crick on both sides,
and the crick was so full oâ rocks that theâ was only two places a
hoss could cross. He had strung barb wire through the cottonwoods in a
regular tangle along the crick, and the only places he had to watch in
case of an attack, were the ravine and these two fords. He could see
for miles in all directions by goinâ to the head oâ the ravine; and
you could hardly pick out a purtier place for a last-stand ân the one
he had selected.

The new cabin for the woman was right in front oâ the mouth oâ the
ravine, the old cabin a hundred yards or so farther on, the cook-house
and the Chinkâs quarters to the north oâ this, the mess-hall for the
men to the east of this, the barn, wagon-sheds, workshop, and so on,
some distance to the south, and the bunk-shack a little to the north
of the stables. He had several corrals back oâ the barn and a pasture
of about thirty acres shut in by a wire fence.

After I had cooled off a little, I saw that the Friar was right. The
thing we couldnât tell was, just how much they had forced Promotheus
to confess. If they had simply got Ty jealous that he was tryinâ to
get the woman away, we might make it all the worse by charginâ down on
âem; while on the other hand he might have told where we were, and Ty
might take it into his head to try to get us all. This last would have
been the finest thing âat could happen to us; but theâ was no way to
tell; so after eatinâ supper, we went down to the edge oâ the cliff to
see what we could see.

We were most of us surprised to see how far the cabin stood from the
cliff. In lookinâ down from our look-out, we had failed to take the
slope into account so it had looked as though we had been able to see
the woman the minute she had come out oâ the mouth of the ravine,
while the fact was the cabin stood several hundred feet from the
mouth. If it hadnât been for the confounded dogs, we could have gone
down and found out what we wanted to know. We made some remarks about
those dogs which would have seared their hair off if theyâd âaâ been a
little closer.

The light was kept in the mess-hall long after time to finish eatinâ;
and we guessed they were tryinâ Promotheus, right while we were
lookinâ on from above. All of a sudden, Olaf struck his palm with his
fist, and exclaimed: âWhat a fool I have been! Those dogs remembered
Promotheus, and he never patted âem. I have patted âem and spoke
soothinâ words to âem, and they would know me. I shall go down and
listen.â

Now this was a noble thought and we hadnât a word to say againâ it; so
Olaf went back to camp, shed his boots and put on moccasins. Slim was
a good shot with a rifle, so he staid with Horace, who had an elephant
gun and a yearninâ to use it, up on the cliff above the mouth oâ the
ravine. They had seven rifles of one kind and another, and they
thought they could make a disturbance if Olaf started anything. The
rest of us went down the ravine to the last curve. We tried to get the
Friar to stay behind; but his blood was up, and he wouldnât heed us.
We had it made up to rope and tie him hand and foot, when we were
finally ready to wind things up with Ty Jones.

Olaf left us with his big, hard face set into rigid lines. He had a
long score to settle with Ty Jones, and he had made a funny gruntinâ
hum in his throat every few steps as we had walked down the ravine. We
waited what seemed weeks; but theâ was no uproar, and finally, he came
out oâ the gloom, and spoke to us in a whisper. We went back with him
to the top oâ the path before he told us what he had heard.

He said they were tryinâ to make Promotheus confess who was back of
him; but that Promotheus had steadily refused. He said âat Ty had told
him over and over that if he would tell him where he could lay hands
on either the Friar or Dinky Bradford, he would give him a month to
get out oâ the country himself; but Promotheus had stood firm, and
they had shut him up in the workshop again, tellinâ him he would get
nothinâ but water until he did confess.

This made us some easier in our minds. Promotheus had acted so worn
out and done up since his return, that he had fooled Ty; and Ty looked
upon him as a broke-down man, and nothinâ but a tool in the hands of
some stronger men. Olaf said âat Ty acted as though he thought the
Friar had sent in a report to the government, and had got Bradford to
come out here the time that Promotheus had disappeared; and in some
way they had got word oâ Horace cominâ through Bosco this last time.
Dixon had told about seeinâ us at Skeltyâs, and a strange feller told
about beinâ shot at, the night Olafâs cabin had been fired. They
bunched all this together, and decided âat the best thing to do was to
trade Promotheus for Horace or the Friar, if it could be done. I had a
chuckle all to myself, when I pictured Horace as he had been when I
took him in hand, and now with the reputation he hadnât quite earned,
beinâ a worry to the Ty Jones outfit.

âI allus said they were cowards,â sez Horace, as soon as Olaf had
finished his tale. âA manâs got an imagination, and as soon as he
starts to live like a wolf, this imagination fills the world with
watchdogs. Ty Jones never has fought in the open, and weâll have no
trouble with him as soon as we once get him on the run.â

âTy Jones has no fear,â sez Olaf. âI know; I have seen with my own
eyes. He is too clever to be trapped; but he has no fear.â

âWell, wait and see,â sez Horace.

Me and Tank kept watch on the cliff until morninâ and then as nothinâ
had happened, we went up to camp, and Slim and Dutch took watch at our
regular look-out. As we sat down to breakfast, we noticed âat the
Friar was gone. Several spoke of him havinâ been restless the night
before and not turninâ in when the rest did. The Friar allus was
unregular in his habits, especially at night; so we didnât pay much
heed to him when he wrote by the fire, or went off by himself in the
quiet starlight, to sing some oâ the pressure off his heart; but at
such a time as this, we anticipated him to be as circumspect as
possible.

We started to hunt him up, but it didnât take long. Horace found a
note pinned to the Friarâs tarp, and the note told us that he had
thought it all over careful durinâ the night, and had decided that his
duty compelled him to go down and offer himself in exchange for
Promotheus. He said that when things came to such a tangle that no
human ingenuity could unmix âem, it was time to put trust in a higher
power; that it was for him that Promotheus had risked his life, and
that he felt he must take his place, as Ty had promised to let
Promotheus go if he would betray him. He said that he could not see
any way to help the woman, and that if he lost his life, for us not to
think of revenge, as it would all turn out for the best in some
mysterious way. The Friar had gone through a lot durinâ the last few
years, and it had finally undermined his patience. I knew just how he
felt: he wanted something to happen which would end his suspense, and
he didnât care much what it was.

As soon as Horace had finished readinâ; we all sat around in complete
silence, gawkinâ at each other. âThings has finally come to a head,â
sez Spider Kelley, solemnly.

âThere now, thatâs the Christian religion!â exclaimed Horace. âThe
Christian religion is founded on self-sacrifice and martyrdom, and all
those who get it bad enough spend the bulk oâ their time on the
lookout to be martyrs and sacrifice theirselves for somethingâand
they donât care much what for. Look at the crusadesâthe flower oâ
Europe was lured into the desert and dumped there like worn-out junk,
even children were offered up in this sacrifice. Nothing but
sentimentality, rank sentimentality. Now, when the ancient Greeksââ

âThe thing for us, is to decide on what weâre to do next, not what the
ancient Greeks did a few thousand years before we were born,â sez I.
âThere is no use hidinâ any longer. The strongest card we have up our
sleeve is the fake reputation of Dinky Bradford, and what we must do
is to make up the best plan to play it.â

âWhy do you say fake reputation?â demanded Horace.

âWell, youâre not a government agent, are ya?â I asked.

âNo,â sez he; âbut at the same timeââ

âI didnât say âat you was a fake, Horace,â sez I in a soothinâ voice.
âI merely intimated that the things Ty Jones most fears about you are
the things which were not so.â

âI see what you mean,â sez Horace, âand itâs all right. Whatâs your
plan?â

âWell, as soon as we are sure âat the Friar has reached Tyâs,â sez I,
âweâll send Ty word to deliver him back at once, and to appoint a
meetinâ place to explain things to us. Not make any threats nor bluffs
nor nothinâ. Just a plain, simple statement of what we want done, and
sign your name to it.â

âI think it would be better to tell him we had his place surrounded,â
said Horace.

âNope,â said I, âyour old theory is best: let their imaginations
supply the details. If we put the government into their minds too
strong, theyâre likely to find some way to deliver Promotheus over to
the law. I have a sort of impediment that The was a little rough with
an officer or two, after he deserted, and Ty knows all about him.â

âHow the deuce will we get word to Ty?â sez Horace. âAs fast as weâd
send messengers, Ty would shut âem up.â

âOne thing is certain, at least,â sez I. âTy wonât string âem up as
long as he knows heâs beinâ watched. And another thing is, that all of
Tyâs men are wanted for one thing or another, and the longer we keep
âem in suspense, the sooner theyâll weaken. We ought to send word to
the Simpson boys. They are at least two to one againâ us as we stand
now.â

Just at this junction, Slim arrived with the news that the Friar was
ridinâ up to the ford. I was purty sure âat he wouldnât go down by the
ravine. The Friar might lack judgment in certain matters; but you
could count on him lookinâ out for his friends, every time.

We hustled down to the look-out, and saw the Friar ride out into the
open, and hail the house. In a minute theâ was a crowd about him and
they pulled him from his hoss and dragged him toward the mess-hall,
actinâ mighty jubilant. The dogs raised a considâable fuss; but they
didnât let any of âem get to the Friar this time. I donât know whether
they were tryinâ to save the Friar or the dogs.

They took the Friar into the mess-hall, and kept him there a good long
time; but I felt sure he wouldnât tell more ân he wanted to. Then they
brought him out and shut him up in the workshop with Promotheus.

âYou donât see âem turninâ Promotheus loose, do ya?â sez olâ Tank.

âTy Jones would cheat himself playinâ solitaire,â sez Spider Kelley.

âHe didnât agree to turn Promotheus loose if the Friar surrendered,â
sez Olaf. âHe only said he would if Promotheus enticed the Friar into
a trap.â

Ty Jones certainly did have what ya call personal magnetism. His men
stuck up for him, even when they was willinâ to help snuff him out.

We sent Oscar over to get the Simpson boys; and then we made our
plans. Theâ was no way to get to our camp from above, and we could
easy guard the two trails âat led up from below. Nothinâ would have
suited us better ân to have Ty decide to come and get us; so we told
Oscar to make all the fuss he wanted when he came back.

Nothinâ happened down at the ranch that day. The woman drifted about,
the same as usual, not seeminâ to observe âat theâ was anything
different from ordinary, and the punchers all stayed in sight. A few
of âem rode up to high spots across the crick and took gappinâs, and a
couple of âem came up the ravine and examined the ground on top; but
they didnât seem to find anything to interest âem.

That night Horace wrote an order on Ty Jones to release the Friarâwe
had decided not to mention Promotheusâand Olaf started down with the
message. We posted ourselves the same as we had done before; and after
about an hour, Olaf returned.

He said he had examined the workshop, which was of logs, the same as
the rest oâ the buildinâs, and had heard the Friar and Promotheus
talkinâ; but hadnât ventured to say anything for fear they were
watched. He said âat the Friar was holdinâ out on the value oâ
fastinâ; while Promotheus was speakinâ in defence of ham anâ eggs.
Then he said he had crept up to the front door of the old cabin, and
had fastened up the order with a dagger.

Olaf looked to me as though he had been enjoyinâ himself a little more
ân his tale gave reason for; so I pressed him, and finally he admitted
that there had been a man on watch at the mouth oâ the ravine. He said
he had wriggled through it on his belly, thinkinâ it too good a place
to be overlooked since the Friar had put âem on their guard; and after
lyinâ still a moment, he had heard the man move. He said he had snaked
up to him, and had got him by the throat. He said he thought it was
Dixon because theâ was so much throat to get hold of. Dixon had been
perfectly resigned to havinâ Olaf lynched that time and Olafâs memory
was not oâ the leaky kind.

âWhat became of him, Olaf?â I asked.

âOh, he fought some,â said Olaf.

âDid he get away?â I asked.

âUn, yesâyes he got away,â sez Olaf.

âWhere did he go to?â sez I.

âI think he went downâway down,â sez Olaf.

âDown where?â sez I. âWhy donât you tell us what happened to him?â

Olaf looked down at his right hand. It didnât resemble a hand much;
but it would âaâ been a handy tool to use in maulinâ wedges into a
log. âWhy,â sez he, âhe wriggled about, and started to squeak; and
when I squeezed in on his neck to shut off the squeak, why his neck
broke. It was too thin to be stout.â

I held out my hand. âOlaf,â I sez, âI want to shake the hand that
shook his neck.â

âYes,â sez Tank, âand by dad, so do I!â Tankâs leg was still tender.




CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE

SKIRMISHES


Oscar arrived durinâ the night with the whole four Simpson boys; and
word that Kit and the kid were in fine shape, with olâ man Simpson
keepinâ a sharp watch, and Kit ready to take a standpat hand any time
trouble crowded too close. We expected to keep Ty busy, and so didnât
worry any about Kit. Before dawn we started the four Simpsons out to
make a circle and cross the crick, tellinâ âem to use their own
judgment to some extent; but not to run any risk. We wanted âem to act
like scouts and, if possible, to draw Ty into chasinâ âem, and then to
lead him back to our camp. We could see all of the other side oâ the
crick from our look-out.

By dawn the rest of us were down on the edge of the cliff, and we saw
âem find Dixonâs body. They were considâable excited about it; so we
judged they had also read the notice on the door.

âWhat shall we do, to-day?â asked Horace.

âShoot dogs,â sez I. âThere ainât any call to play safe any longer,
and those dogs are the worst bother we have.â

âAll right,â sez Horace. âThis will be a good chance for me to see if
Iâm still in practice. Iâm a purty good rifle-shot, Happy.â

I never could quite harden myself to Horace. The change in him was
almost as much as that between an egg and a chicken; but yet theâ was
still a suggestion of what he had been at firstâhis side-burns, most
likelyâand it allus jarred me to see him steaminâ ahead with
self-confidence fizzinâ out of his safety valve. He took his elephant
gun and trained it on one oâ the dogs which was sniffinâ around the
place where Dixonâs body had lain. We were purty well off to the north
of the ravine; but it was still a considâable angle of a down-shot,
and a good long one too.

âRemember,â sez I, âthat when shootinâ down grade, you are mighty apt
to shoot too high.â

He lowered his gun anâ looked at me as though I had called him a girl
baby. âI have shot from every angle theâ is,â sez he; âand Iâve shot
big game, too.â

âEx-cuse _me_!â sez I. âShoot now, and letâs see what happens.â

You had to take off your hat to Horace when it came to a cultivated
taste in firearms. The thing he had got Promotheus with had been small
enough to conceal in your back hair, while his present instrument
wasnât rightly a rifle at all, it was a half-grown cannon. It shot a
bullet as big as your thumb which mushroomed out and exploded, as soon
as it hit. The dog died a merciful death; but he left a mighty
disquietinâ bunch oâ remains.

âGood boy, Horace!â I said, slappinâ him on the shoulder. âYou keep on
removinâ the dogs, and Iâll go up the slope, and pertect your rear,
should they try to come up the ravine.â

I heartily endorsed this slaughter oâ the dogs; but I wasnât ambitious
to see it done. I have been well acquainted with a large number oâ
dogs of all sorts and sizes, and I have deep feelinâs for dogs. When
it comes to livinâ accordinâ to a fellerâs own standard, a dog has us
all beat. When a dog signs up, he donât whisper nothinâ under his
breath. He signs up for the full trip, and he donât ask a lot oâ
questions about how long the hoursâll be, or what sort oâ grub and
quarters and pay heâll draw. He just wags his tail, and sez: âThis
here feller is my idea of exactly what a feller ought to be; and Iâm
for him in all he does. If he wants me to fight, Iâm hungry for it, if
he wants me to be polite and swaller a lot oâ insults, Iâll do it, or
if the time comes when my death is worth more to him ân my life, why,
I donât know nothinâ about future rewards or such truck; but Iâm
perfectly willinâ to swap life for death in his name, and Iâm proud to
take the consequencesâso long as he gets the reward.â

I own up âat a dog has no morality; heâs only a reflection of his
master. A decent man has a decent dog, a vicious man has a vicious
dogâand this is why it would have hurt me more to watch Horace
testinâ his aim on the dogs ân it would if he had been minded to pot a
few Cross-branders themselves, especially Ty Jones.

Now, the sound oâ this gun, and the sight of the dead dog made things
buzz down below. The men peered out from all directions, but hardly
knew what to do. I had sent Mexican Slim off to the right, just above
the ravine, to pick off any dogs âat came in that direction, and soon
after Horace got his, Slim also got one; and Ty whistled the dogs to
come to the house. Here was where his method of treatinâ a dog showed
up bad. Any time before this, a dog which so much as set foot on the
porch had been belted with anything capable of inflictinâ pain, and
now they refused to go inside.

The Chink was able to whistle âem to the cook-house; but that was as
far as theyâd go; and while they were standinâ in a bunch, Horace and
Slim each got one. Ty was standinâ near one oâ the poles which upheld
the back porch, and Horace exploded a slab from this pole in such a
way that it knocked Ty down. This put the whole bunch into a
consternation. Horace certainly could shoot some. It made me think oâ
the poorhouse, when I reflected on what it had cost him to learn how.

Nothinâ much happened that day. Horace and Slim stuck to their
knittinâ, and the Simpson boys played their part well. They rode in a
bunch, and when theyâd come in sight oâ the ranch house, one would
hold the field-glass case to his eyes, as though lookinâ through the
field glasses, and another would turn and wave his hands, as though
signallinâ to some one up in the hills. Once, two punchers went to the
corral and saddled hosses; but Horace shot one oâ the hosses, and both
men flew for the stable without waitinâ to take off the saddles. They
had never seen such wounds as Horaceâs elephant gun created, and it
put âem in a mighty thoughtful mood.

The Simpson boys came in soon after dark; and we all held a council of
war while eatinâ supper. I was purty certain that we had a better
bunch oâ men than those we were fightinâ. It is no test of nerve to
kill a man: a lot oâ men who got the reputation oâ beinâ bad were
nothinâ but accidents or sneaks; but when you have to stick through a
slow fight without knowinâ the odds againâ ya, it gives your nerve a
mighty searchinâ try-out. I had hopes that after a day or so, theyâd
be certain that the hills on all sides of âem were full of enemies,
and theyâd be mighty glad to settle on our terms. I didnât want to
kill a single man more ân was necessary. Horace also thought we could
wear out their nerve; but Olaf shook his head.

âSome oâ the punchers may desert in the night,â sez he; âbut as long
as a single one remains to stand back to back with Ty Jones, Ty
Jonesâll stay and fight. He has no fearâI have seen.â

âThe question is this,â sez I, âif those fellers are the kind to get
fiercer the longer theyâre kept in suspense, the thing to do is to
raid âem to-night; but, on the other hand, if theyâre the kind whose
nerve evaporates when it is kept uncovered, the thing to do is to wear
âem down. Letâs vote on it.â

We decided to do some more wearinâ; so we kept a guard at the camp,
and the rest of us went down to the cliff, and tossed over stones to
where we thought theyâd be hid, providinâ they had put guards at the
mouth of the ravine. We raised a yelp the first throw, and heard a
rush oâ men from the new cabin, though the shadow was so dense down
below we couldnât see a thing. This showed us that some oâ the dogs
still survived and were beinâ used as guards, and also that there were
men quartered in the womanâs cabin. This was a bother, as it would
force us to be careful until we found out where she was livinâ.

We posted a guard at the top of the path leadinâ up from the ravine,
another at our camp, and went to sleep, feelinâ purty tolâable well
fixed. Nothinâ happened that night, and the next day, we made ready to
do about the same as we had done the day before; but when we reached
the cliff, theâ wasnât a sign oâ life belowânot a single, breathinâ
thing in sight, not even a hoss in the pasture.

âTheyâve got away!â exclaimed Horace.

âWhere to?â sez Olaf. âTy Jones hasnât any more use for the law ân we
have, and youâll never make me believe âat heâs pulled out and left
all his belonginâs for whoever wants âem.â

âThatâs so,â sez I; âbut where the deuce are they?â

We watched all morninâ; but not a sign, not a bit oâ smoke from the
cook-house, just the ranch buildinâs settinâ there as deserted as the
Garden of Eden. The Simpsons were workinâ their stunts across the
crick; so about ten in the morninâ, Slim and Dutch rode over to tell
âem to come in, as they would look mighty foolish, providinâ they were
makinâ signals to one of the hills where the Cross-branders themselves
were hid.

After eatinâ dinner, the rest of us went down to the lookout, Horace
shoulderinâ his elephant exterminator, and lookinâ peevish and
fretful, âcause theâ was nothinâ to shoot at. âBoys,â sez I, âdo ya
suppose âat poor old Promotheus has been goinâ all this time on
nothinâ but water.â

âHeâs gone longer ân this on nothing but water,â sez Horace; âand so
have I. Over in Africa, once, we sent a tribe oâ blacks around to beat
some lions out for us; but they fell in with another tribe who were
not friendly, and they just kept on goinâ. Promotheus and I were lost
from everything, and we got into a desert before we found a way out.
We went for I donât know how long without water. Anyway, we went long
enough to get into that numb condition when the earth becomes molten
copper, and the sky a sun glass, and a man himself feels like another
manâs nightmare. That tender old Promotheus youâre sympathizinâ with,
carried me the best part of a day, or a centuryâtime had melted
entirely awayâand when we came back to our senses we lay beside a
pool of water. Heâs tough, Promotheus is.â

âAt the same time,â sez Tank, âsettinâ cooped up in a log hut with
nothinâ to cheer ya but water, isnât my idy of havinâ high jinks.â

âPerhaps, too,â sez Spider Kelley, who didnât have enough sense of
fitness to change a nickel, âthose mongrel coyotes lynched both him
anâ the Friar before they vamosed.â

âThey wouldnât do that,â sez Olaf; âbut I wish we knew what they had
done.â

âLetâs go and shoot at the old cabin or the bunk-shack,â sez Oscar.

âI move we wait, and raid âem to-night,â sez I, and this was what we
decided to do.

The rest of us lolled about purty patientâas active men, anâ beasts
too, are likely to do when theâs nothinâ on handâbut Horace who had
lived in a room most of his life, hadnât quite learned to turn off his
steam when he hadnât any use for it; so he kept bobbinâ up and fussinâ
about. All of a sudden, he gave a sort of gasp, and pointed up the
slope.

We looked and saw one man crouched over and runninâ along where the
south trail to our camp swung around a crag; and we sprang to our
feet, and looked up at the camp. As we looked, the face of Ty Jones
with a grin on it, poked up over a stone and leered down at us most
exasperatinâ.




CHAPTER FORTY

AN IRRITATING GRIN


Now, you can mighty easy understand that this was a fair sized,
able-bodied, bite-and-kick consternation for us, if ever theâ was one
in the world. Our look-out was behind a ridge which sheltered it
complete from below, but left it as open from above as the straw hat
which Stutterinâ Sam made the dude crawl through. Up above us, lookinâ
down from the rocks in front of our camp was Ty Jones, grinninâ as
self-composed anâ satisfied as a cat which has just removed all
evidence of there ever havinâ been any Canary birds; and truth to
tell, we felt as indiscriminate and embarrassed as a naked man at a
dance party.

All we saw was just Ty and his grin. We knew theâ was one other man
with him, but that was all we did know; while our strength was as
plain to them, as Tillte Dutch was the time he fell in love and used
iodaform on his hair instead oâ perfume. We just stood and looked up
at Ty, and then we turned our heads and looked at each other, and I
never saw as many stupid expressions in one mess. We felt as though
every minute was liable to be our next.

Whenever olâ Tank Williams was surprised or puzzled or wrastlinâ with
his own thoughts, he allus put me in mind of a picture I once saw of a
walrus. The walrus was lounginâ up on a rock, and he looked as solemn
and philosophical as though some young snip of a school boy had tested
his intellect by askinâ him what two times one made. I never saw Tank
look so much like the walrus as he did this time âat Ty Jones
surprised us. Oâ course Tankâs teeth was different, but his mustaches
stuck down in much the same way, and when I looked at him, I busted
out laughinâ, though I own up I was scared enough to stampede the
moment before. When I laughed, it seemed to break the charm, and
before I buttoned up my lips again, Horace had pulled up his elephant
gun, and taken a blast at Tyâs grin. Ty pulled down his face behind
the stone as soon as Horace aimed at him; but the range was long
enough to strain even such a devil-tool as this half-grown cannon, so
nothinâ came of it.

After my chuckle, I began to think in streams. The ground to the right
of usâas we looked up towards Tyâwas broken, and it occurred to me
that he had been holdinâ us with his grin so as to give some of his
men time to sneak down and cut us off, he and the balance were above
us, the ravine to our left, and straight back of us the cliff. We
couldnât stick where we were againâ odds, and there wasnât any water
in the clump of rocks which faced the path where it come out of the
ravine. As I ran over these details in my mind, I had as little
temptation to laugh as I ever did have; but the second I thought of
the clump oâ rocks facinâ the path, I saw that the path itself was the
answer.

There was no reason to hurry, as far as I could see; they could not
come to us without exposinâ themselves, and every moment we waited,
the closer would come Dutch, Slim, and the four Simpson boys. To the
right of us, as I said, the ground was broken, and here was where they
would be most likely to sneak down on us. By goinâ in a diagonal
direction, we could get to where we could see straight up the washes
which made up this broken ground, and so know what we had to fight.

âCome on, fellers,â sez I, climbinâ up over the ridge.

âWhere ya goinâ?â sez Horace.

I sat down on top oâ the ridge. âHave you got any plan?â sez I calmly.

âNo,â sez he, âI havenât; but Iâd like to knowââ

âIf youâre willinâ to take charge,â sez I, âwhy, go ahead, and Iâll
obey orders; but I donât care how small the body is, it canât do quick
work with more ân one head, as you ought to know better ân any of
usâit havinâ been tried frequent in those Greek tales youâre all the
time inflictinâ us with.â

Horace put his back up a little. âIâm willinâ to agree to anything
reasonable,â sez he; âbut I donât see any sense in leavinâ this spot
until we know where weâre goinâ.â

I folded my fingers together, set my thumbs to chasinâ each other, and
began to whistle. I wasnât jealous of Horace; but it just occurred to
me that I had handled men before heâd mustered up courage enough to
stay out after seven oâclock P. M. without gettinâ his motherâs
permission, and I wanted to test the others and see if they thought he
had picked up more craft in three years ân I had in a lifetime; so I
whistled the tune to his song, and looked up at the clouds.

âWhatâs your idee, Happy?â sez olâ Tank. I had nourished Tank on
thought-food for a good long session, and I knew heâd feel mighty much
like a lost calf if I left him to rustle up his own idees; so I just
gave my hands a little toss and kept on with my whistlinâ.

âAw, donât be so blame touchy,â sez Spider Kelley. I had pulled Spider
through a number oâ tight places, also, and I knew heâd soon begin to
feel trapped up and smothery, if I left him to sweat out his own idees
for a few minutes longer; so I gave him the same gesture I had
bestowed on Tank.

âWhat do you think weâd better do, Olaf?â sez Horace.

Olaf looked all around but did not see anything. âThey have come up
the ravine, took the path up the other side, through the clump oâ
trees, made a wide circle and got to our camp,â sez Olaf. âIf we try
to get away, they cut us off. If we stay here, we die for want of
water. If we rush up the hill, they shoot us from behind the rocks.
All I can see is to wait until night, and then make a rush for it.â

âWell, that donât look like much of an idee to me,â sez Horace. I kept
on whistlinâ.

âI move we foller Happy,â sez Spider Kelley.

âI second the motion,â sez Tank.

âIâm willinâ to,â sez Olaf, and Oscar nodded his head. This was about
all Oscar ever used his head for except to hang his hat on; but he was
a good boy and sizey.

âAll right,â sez Horace. âNow then, Happy Hawkins, the responsibility
is on you.â

âNow, be sure you mean this,â sez I; âfor my plan is a foolish one,
and I donât care to explain each step. I donât claim âat my scheme is
the best; but my experience has been, that a poor plan carried out
beats a good plan which never came in. Climb up here, and weâll walk
off in that direction without lookinâ behind us.â

They couldnât see any sense in this; but they follered me without
chatterinâ, and I was satisfied. Horace had the field glasses in his
pocket; so when we had reached the place I thought would do, I set him
to lookinâ across the crick careful to see if he could see anything.
All the others watched him, and I got behind and looked up the slope.
I saw several men hidinâ in the washes, and I said in a low tone:
âKeep on lookinâ across the hill, Horace. Now, you others get out from
behind him. Now, Horace, whirl and examine the washes up the slope and
see how many men you can count.â

Horace whirled, as did all the rest of âem, and we found seven fellers
in sight. We figured âat there must be at least fifteen Cross-branders
in the neighborhood, and probably more, and the ones we were able to
see in the washes convinced me âat Ty had staked everything on gettinâ
us cornered. They didnât have enough to split up, so I felt sure they
would leave the ravine open, not thinkinâ it likely weâd try to go
down there.

âNow,â sez I, âletâs go to that clump oâ rocks and hide.â They all
came along; but didnât seem enthusiastic, because the washes led down
close to the rocksâwe, ourselves, havinâ sneaked down âem while we
were waitinâ for the woman that day. We couldnât see the path the boys
would take in cominâ up to our camp from across the crick, while the
Cross-branders could see âem a good part oâ the way, and this fretted
me a lot; though I hoped they had heard Horaceâs elephant gun.

After a time, Horace, through the glasses, saw a fellerâs head
watchinâ us from our old look-out; so we knew they had crept up along
the back oâ that ridge. Then we heard considâable shootinâ off to the
right, and knew the boys had got back. There were several good places
for ambush, and we felt purty blue at what had most likely happened;
but they were on hossback, and would be on their guard after knowinâ
âat the Cross-branders were up to some trick; so we hoped for the
best.

This clump oâ rocks we were in was composed of one big crag and a lot
oâ little ones. The big one shut off our view, and finally Horace said
it would be a good plan to get on top of it, as the chances were we
could get a good view in all directions. It was fifteen feet up to
where theâ was footinâ, and we didnât see how it could be done; but he
said it was simple; so we let him try it. He made Olaf and Tank face
the rock, holdinâ on to each other. Then I climbed to their shoulders
and they passed up Horace. I handed him up as far as I could reach,
and it was as simple as peelinâ a banana. The signal was for him to
drop a pebble when he wanted to come down.

In about two moments a stone the size oâ your fist fell on Oscarâs
head; which was a good thing, for it might otherwise have hurt a head
we had more use for. We laddered ourselves againâ the rock, and Horace
came down without missinâ a single one of our ears. When he reached
the level, he put his finger on his lips, and said he had seen ten men
sneakinâ up toward the rock and only a few hundred feet away. Oscar
was still holdinâ to the lump on his head, so Horace explained âat
theâ hadnât been any pebbles on top the crag.

âNow, what ya goinâ to do?â asked Horace to me.

âYou, Olaf, and Oscar go around the rock to the left,â sez I; âand
Tank, Spider, and Iâll go around to the right. Each fire only once,
and then run around the rock again and make for the path leadinâ down
into the ravine. Keep close together all the way.â

âThe ravine!â exclaimed Spider.

âSure,â sez I.

âAll right,â sez Spider, dragginâ out the âallâ until it would do for
âI told ya so,â in case we got pocketed.

It worked fine; we flew around, surprised âem, shot a volley into âem,
made âem seek cover, and then we flew for the head oâ the path. Olâ
Tank, with his damaged prop, was as nimble as a one-legged Norman
hoss, and Horace was loaded down with elephant ammunition; so that it
was wise to have all the time we could get. Ty and five others jumped
up from our look-out, and tried to head us off; but they had to go
twice as far as we did. Ty and two others had rifles, and they stopped
and took shots at us, but nothinâ came of it.

âHurry on to the ranch buildinâs,â I called as we went down the path.
Then I turned back, to see what they were doinâ.

âLet me take a shot at âem,â sez Horaceâs voice at my elbow.

âWhy didnât you go on with the rest?â sez I. âI can give you half way
and beat you runninâ.â

âLet me take just one shot,â sez Horace, so I gave in and let him. Two
fellers were runninâ at a long angle toward the mouth oâ the ravine to
head us off, and get a shot from above; so I told him to try for one
oâ them. He fiddled with his hind sight as calm as though shootinâ for
a Christmas turkey, and hanged if he didnât topple one over. The other
stopped, and then ran back with his head ducked low to the ground,
while the wounded one crawled behind a rock.

âNow dust for the buildinâs,â sez I; âand donât try any more nonsense.
Let me carry the weapon, and you wonât be so overloaded. Iâll start
after you in a jiffy.â

When I looked back, I saw that all of âem had slowed down considâable,
out oâ respect to the elephant gun; but I could still count seventeen,
so we hadnât seen âem all before. When they started towards the head
of the path again, I took a shot at Ty Jones; but I didnât savvy the
rear sight, and all it did was to make âem slow down once more. Then I
slid down the path and hot-footed it down the ravine. I saw signs oâ
hosses, so I knew they had rode most of their trip, and would be in a
position to circle around all they wanted to.

I soon caught up with the others, and Tank was puffinâ purty freely.
All the rest were runninâ easy, and we came out oâ the mouth oâ the
ravine without seeinâ a single soul. Now, we hardly knew what to do.
It was about the same distance from the mouth oâ the ravine to the
first curve in it, as it was to the womanâs cabin; so I told Spider to
stay at the corner oâ the cabin, and watch that curve.

Then we went around and found the door locked. We called twice to the
woman, but theâ was no reply; so Olaf picked up a big stone and
knocked off the lock. We made a quick examination; but theâ was no one
there. I posted Horace and Spider in this cabin to watch the mouth oâ
the ravine through the window facinâ it, and to shoot into âem, should
they foller us close.

We next went to the big house, where we had more trouble as everything
was fastened with bars on the inside, except the front door which had
an immense padlock on the outside. We finally broke it off, and out
dashed three oâ their confounded dogs. We killed âem, and went inside;
but theâ was no one else there. Next we went to the workshop, and
after breakinâ off the padlock, we found the Friar and Promotheus
gagged and tied. The Friar was sad, and Promotheus was mad. We sent
âem up to the cook-shack to get on speakinâ terms with food again, and
rummaged the rest oâ the buildinâs; but could find neither the woman
nor the Chink, and by the time we were through, it was gettinâ along
towards dark.

I set Tank to cookinâ a meal while the rest of us carried logs and
piled âem in the mouth oâ the ravine. It would be moonlight up to ten
oâclock, and after that I intended to have a fire to see by. We also
set up some logs at each oâ the two fords. After supper we divided
into two equal groups oâ four each, to stand guard, each man to watch
two hours, one at the window of the new cabin, the other from the
porch of the old one, where a view across both fords could be had.

The Friar was purty downcast at our not beinâ able to find the woman,
and at our still beinâ in a state oâ war; but he didnât kick none. He
promised not to go over and surrender himself any more, and said he
would stand guard careful, and warn us the first thing âat happened.
We decided âat they would probably attack us that night, and we
finally chose the old shack, as it had water piped into it from a
spring a hundred yards above. I figured âat theyâd be most apt to come
down the ravine, so I picked out the Friar, Olaf, and Tank to help me
watch it, and the others to take turns watchinâ the fords.

About half past nine, we lit the fires and turned in, with Oscar on
the porch, and Olaf at the window of the new cabin. I thought they
wouldnât come before two oâclock, and had it arranged so âat the last
ford watches would be held by Spider and Promotheus.




CHAPTER FORTY-ONE

THE NIGHT-ATTACK


I wasnât sleepy, and lyinâ stretched out is the worst cure for
sleeplessness âat ever I tried; so after twistinâ about for a while, I
got up and took a look around. Oscar hadnât seen a thing, which I took
to be a mighty encouraginâ sign. Mostly, when you set a boy on guard
he rouses ya out to meet the enemy every fifteen minutes, and then
goes to sleep just before the enemy actually does arrive; but Olaf had
trained Oscar to do what he was told, as he was toldâwhen he was
toldâand then not to talk about it for a couple oâ years afterward.
Oscar was reliable to a degree; but for conversational purposes, Iâd
sooner have been shipwrecked with a brindle bull pup.

I didnât have any doubts of Olaf; but I dropped in to see what sort of
a view he had, now that it had got dark. The fire was burninâ high,
and the ravine was as bright as day. Enough oâ the fire would last
until morninâ to give a good view, so I strolled down around the
bunk-shack and stables. I saw a form movinâ in the shadow oâ the
cottonwoods, and stalked it careful, finally gettinâ close enough to
make out the Friar.

âCanât ya sleep, Friar?â sez I.

âNo, no, I canât sleep,â sez he with a sigh. âWhere do you think she
is, Happy?â

âThey probably took her with âem; and left the Chink to guard her,
back in the hills,â sez I. âNo matter what happens, theyâre not liable
to harm her.â

âItâs sore hard to be patient,â sez the Friar. âI am honestly opposed
to all violence and bloodshed. I have allus believed that all wars
were useless and unnecessary; but itâs sometimes hard for me to love
my enemies.â

âYouâre just worried and canât see clear,â sez I soothinâly. âItâs
plain enough if you just think it outâthatâs the best part oâ
religion. One place it sez: âLove your enemies.â In another it sez:
âFoller the Lordâs example.â In still another it sez: âWhom he loves,
he chastenethââwhich you said meant to punish. Now then, you have it
all worked out: the proper way to love your enemy is to punish him;
and, accordinâ to this rule, weâre goinâ to love the hide off oâ one
oâ your enemies, if so be weâre able to do it.â

But the Friar never would stand for havinâ his religion doctored to
suit the taste, he had to take it as stiff and raw as alcohol, where
he was concerned, himself; so he turned in and explained things to me
until from my standpoint, misery was the only religious excuse a
feller had for beinâ happy.

By this, it was time to change watches, so the Friar relieved Olaf,
while Horace and his elephant-pest went out on the front porch to
watch the fords, and I turned in. None of us took our boots off that
night; we had a little fire in the big room, and slept on the floor,
holdinâ our belts in our hands. I drowsed off quick enough this time,
knowinâ âat Tank and Promotheus would be next on watch and certain not
to let anything surprise them.

Sure enough, just about the time we had slept ourselves into complete
forgetfulness, we were all jerked to our feet by the first shot Tank
fired, and this one shot was followed by a bunch of others. The
Cross-branders had crept down the ravine, and a little after three
when the fire had burned low, they had tried to get by unnoticed. Olâ
Tank only had one eye, but it was a workinâ eye, if ever theâ was one,
and he shot two of âem with one oâ their own rifles, and when they
rushed him in a body, spreadinâ out wide, he retreated to the old
cabin, accordinâ to directions.

The old cabin had loopholes in it, and we had found three fairly good
rifles, but not much ammunition. We didnât waste any shots while it
was still dark; but they fired at us now and again. They had brought
the five rifles we had left at our camp, and used âem freely. Slim had
taken the other rifle with him.

All durinâ that day they broke the monotony by takinâ frequent shots
at us; but the logs in the cabin had been matched up for just such a
purpose, and not one of us was even scratched with a splinter. What we
were most afraid of was, âat they would find some way to set fire to
the cabin, and we counted on that beinâ one oâ the nightâs
diversities.

There were three good sized rooms in the old cabin which was only one
story high. One big room occupied the full south half oâ the cabin, a
bedroom was in the northeast corner, and a library in the northwest
corner. Yes, sir, a regular library, and the Friar and Horace both
said it was a choice collection oâ books. Horace showed us one book
which had a photograph of the original Prometheus chained to a rock
with the vultures peckinâ at his liver, and he certainly must have
been some man to stand it. This picture made Theâs eyes light up
considâable.

Theâ was also some chromos of naked stone images on the wall, which
the Friar and Horace called mighty fine copies. They were purty well
dumb-founded to find âat Ty Jones didnât live as much like a bob-cat
as theyâd thought. Under the book shelves was a row oâ locked drawers.
They stuck out farther than the shelves above âem, and we wanted to
pry âem open to see what was inside; but the Friar wouldnât let us.

That was a wearinâ day, and we were all glad when it finally dragged
itself to the lake oâ darkness, and dove in. We had our minds made up
for a busy night, but waitinâ for trouble is more crampinâ to the soul
than beinâ in the midst of it, so we felt cheerfuller as soon as night
actually settled down.

We didnât dare have a fire in the fireplace, for fear it would show
âem our loopholes, and we didnât care to advertise these any more ân
was necessary; but we set a lighted candle far back in the fireplace,
to see to load by. The fireplace was across the southwest corner oâ
the big room. There were no loopholes in the library, but we feared
the light might leak through a chink in the window shutter, so we
didnât have any light there. We kept one man watchinâ through
loopholes in the bedroom, and two watchinâ in the big room, and were
able to cover the whole neighborhood.

The cook-shack was the nearest buildinâ, and only the two loopholes in
the north end oâ the bedroom covered that; so we decided to fling the
library window open and fire through that, in case they made a rush
from that direction. We knew they wouldnât be likely to start anything
until after eleven, as the moon wouldnât set until then, so we
stretched out on the floor, leavinâ Oscar, Horace, and Spider on
watch.

When a feller has been keepinâ his attention wound up for several
days, his mainspring finally gets strained, and the cogs in his head
get to cuttinâ up regardless. I managed to get a purty fair dab oâ
sleep; but it seemed as though I dove straight out oâ wakefulness into
a dream, and it was some the rottenest dream I ever had. I dreamed
that Ty Jones had come and stooped over me and asked me what I thought
oâ the way he had conducted his life. In a dream a feller is apt to do
the foolest things imaginable, so I looked up into Tyâs face and told
him my true opinion. I sez to him: âTy, if your brains were blastinâ
powder, they wouldnât make enough explosion to raise your hat.â

Ty didnât take kindly to this opinion; so he jumped into the air and
lightinâ on my face, began to trample it with his heels. The
discomfort of this wakened me; but at first I didnât know I was awake.
Several men had been actually tramplinâ on me, and theâ was a general
fight takinâ place in that room which was hard to make head or tail
of.

In the flickerinâ candle rays, it was mighty bothersome to tell who
from which; so theâ was no shootinâ. Aside from Ty and Pepper Kendal,
we averaged bigger ân they did, except Horace and Spider. Spider had
length but he ran small in the arms and legs, while Horace was
twenty-two caliber any way you looked at him. They abused Horace some
considâable, and he got kicked and trampled on purty liberal; but he
was of terrier blood, and the second or third time he got kicked into
a corner, he crawled out on his hands anâ knees, picked out a pair oâ
legs which was strange to him, wrapped his arms about âem, and fetched
their owner to the floor with a thump. I spared enough time to knock
the feller on the head; and then Horace played his trick over again.

Olaf was a mad bull in a mix-up like thisâHorace said he had
beershirker blood in him, and this must be good stuff for it made Olaf
grin when Horace accused him of it. Oâ course theâ ainât much head or
tail to such a fight, and in lookinâ back on it, itâs just like
spurtinâ the pages of a picture-book with your thumb and tryinâ to
observe the pictures. I saw the Friar leaninâ againâ the mantel-piece
with a hurt look on his face; and it disgusted me.

In times oâ peace, I respected his prejudice againâ violence; but this
was no time for foolishness, and I recall mutterinâ to myself a wish
that Horace might have the loan of his big body for the next half
hour. I saw Olaf knock down two men with one blow, I saw The save olâ
Tankâs life, just as a half-breed was about to knife him from behind;
but for the most part it was just about as orderly a mess as a
popper-ful oâ corn over a bed oâ coals.

The fight didnât last more ân five or ten minutes. They had banked on
surprisinâ us; and when this failed they were ready to back out. I
afterward found out that it was the Friar who had caught sight of âem
first, he notâ beinâ able to sleep.

Ty and Pepper Kendal were the last to leave the big room; and when
their own men were out of it, they opened fire on us; we fired back,
and when they backed into the library where the rest oâ their gang had
disappeared, we made a rush for âem. I supposed they had come in
through the library window, and I called for a candle, hopinâ to grab
Ty before he could get out.

Spider Kelley had already picked up the candle, and he had it in the
doorway in a second. The big drawers at the bottom oâ the bookcase
were swung back, showinâ a stairway behind âem, and Ty Jones stood at
the top with Pepper Kendal just behind him. I dove through the air,
catchinâ Tyâs wrist with my left hand and his throat with my right,
Pepper Kendal bent his gun on me, Olaf grabbed the gun which was fired
just as The grabbed Pepperâs arms. It looked to me as though the
bullet must have gone into Olafâs head; but just then we tripped,
rolled down the stairs and the imitation drawers swung to behind us.

All holts were broke on the way down, and when I reached the bottom, I
lay as quiet as a frozen moonbeam. I heard steps runninâ away from me
in the dark, and presently the legs of the man next to me moved, and
he got up. I rose to a crouchinâ position, held my arm above my head,
and whispered, âWho is this?â

For answer, I got a smash on the arm with the butt of a forty-five
which drove it down againâ my head hard enough to bring me to my knees
and wake up my horse-sense. I might âaâ known theyâd have a signal.

I waited with my back againâ the wall until the silence began to soak
into my nerve. One oâ my guns had got lost durinâ the mess upstairs;
but I still had the other, and when I closed my grip around it, it
seemed like I was shakinâ hands with my best friend. As far as I could
discover I hadnât been shot; but several knife-cuts and bruises began
to hum little tunes which wasnât in nowise cheerinâ. I just simply
donât like to be kept waitinâ in the dark!

After a bit I reached my hand out cautious, and felt the heel of a
ridinâ boot. I examined as careful as though the feller inside the
boot was a disguised bear-trap; but theâ was no need. His neck was
broke. I felt of his face, and it was soft and smooth. The face of the
young feller with the boyâs eyes, I had seen put to bed drunk that
night at Skeltyâs, flashed across me, and I gave a sigh; but I had too
much on my mind to turn soft, so I began to feel around again.

Presently my fingers struck the heel of another boot. I shut down on
my bellows until the breath didnât get down past the top inch oâ my
neck, and I was as gentle with the heel oâ that boot, as though it was
a bitinâ manâs eyeball; because I sure felt a quiver in it. I slid my
fingers up that boot a quarter inch at a time, and I didnât use no
more rudeness ân a mouse would use in tryinâ to sneak a cheese piller
out from under a sleepinâ cat. When my fingers finally struck
corduroy, I purt nigh gave a shout, for this was what Promotheus wore.

It allus embarrasses a man to be felt over in the dark, so I took my
time with The; but after locatinâ both hands and his crooked mouth, I
discovered heâd been knocked out complete. I rubbed his wrists until
he began to moan, and then I pinched his nose until he was able to
notice my name when I whispered. He had bumped his head in fallinâ,
and it made him sick to the stomach; so while he was gettinâ tuned up
again, I prospected around.

I crawled up the stairs but couldnât hear a sound, I scratched with my
fingers, knocked softly, and pushed until my eyes began to hurt; so I
knew âat the only way out for us was to follow the Cross-branders.
Things had happened so sudden up above that I hadnât an idy as to how
many were fightinâ us; but I was still purty certain that a fair sized
bunch had run out the tunnel just as I dove into it, and I didnât
choose to bump into âem in the dark.

When I came down the stairs, The felt able again; so we started to
prospect. We agreed that strikinâ our teeth together would be our
signal, and then we made our examination. The right side oâ the tunnel
was smooth, the way Nature works, the left side was rough, and
indicated manâs doinâs. Aside from us two, the only other one in the
tunnel was the boy with the broken neck; but the tunnel opened into a
big cave, and we didnât know what to do about it.

Finally we started around the right hand wall, me crawlinâ first, and
Theâs fingers touchinâ my boot at every move. After goinâ some
distance, a great, straggly gray form rose up from the floor oâ the
cave, and gave me a shock which stopped my entire works. I kept my
presence oâ mind all right; but Iâd âaâ been mighty glad to swap it
off for absence of body. This was a most ghastly lookinâ form, and I
nestled up againâ the side oâ the wall, and felt my hand back for The.
He crawled up alongside oâ me, and when he spied it, he gave a start
which made his teeth click. âWhatâs that?â he whispered.

Itâs funny how the mind works. This form didnât resemble anything
earthly; so I hadnât really tried to figure on it much; but when The
threw his question at me, I looked at the shape more careful, and grew
ashamed oâ myself. Here was I, a feller who had spent considâable time
around mines, and yet had got all balled up over seeinâ things
underground.

âThatâs your old friend, daylight, cominâ down through a hole, The,â I
whispered so prompt that I doubt if he noticed any gap.

He gave a sniff through his nose, and then we crept on to where this
light was cominâ in through the opposite tunnel. It was mighty weak
and sickly lookinâ light, but the outline oâ the tunnel mouth soon got
perfectly plain to us. Every few inches we stopped to listen; but we
got clear to the mouth without hearinâ anything. Then we paused. Just
at that time, Iâd have given right smart to have had my eyes fastened
on like those of a lobster I once saw in a window down at Frisco. This
insect had his eyes fixed to the ends oâ fingers which he could
stretch out in any direction.

To be honest, I felt some reluctant to push my face around that
corner; but when I did there wasnât a thing in sight. The tunnel
stretched ahead of us for what seemed miles, but we couldnât see the
outer openinâ, although the light was strong enough to recognize each
other by. The was a sight, for the bump on his head had leaked
continuous; but it hadnât disabled him none, so we drew back to
consult a little.

If we had known whether they were ahead or behind us, it would have
been easy to decide; but under the circumstances, we hardly knew what
to do. Beinâ in the dark was one thing; but beinâ out where we could
be seen was still another; so we thought full and deep.

After a few minutes I told The a little story about a feller I helped
to pick up after he had jumped from a thirty-foot ledge onto a pile oâ
stone. âWhy did you do it?â sez I. He blinked his eyes at me a time âr
two, hove a long sigh, anâ said: âTheâ was a purple dragon in front oâ
me, a lot oâ long-legged yaller snakes back oâ me, and the peskiest
pink jack-rabbit you ever saw kept swoopinâ into my face anâ peckinâ
at my eyes. If I ever drink another drop, I hope itâll drown me.â

The considered this story careful, anâ then we crawled out into the
tunnel, rose to our feet, anâ ran along crouchinâ. The tunnel ran
upward at a sharp incline, which was why the light came down it so
far. We kept to the right wall, and after goinâ some distance, we came
across a small cave. In this we found another dead Cross-brander; but
we werenât enough interested in him to risk strikinâ a light; so we
sat down a moment to rest and listen.

Presently we noticed some curious noises, but for some minutes we
couldnât decide on what they were. Suddenly The grabbed my wrist anâ
said: âThatâs shootinâ; thatâs what that is!â

It was as plain as home-cookinâ the minute he pointed it out; so we
rose to our feet and made a rush for the mouth oâ the cave. We came
out about half way up the face oâ the cliff; and for a moment we
paused to admire Ty Jonesâs foxiness. This openinâ couldnât be seen
from below, nor noticed from above, and for the most part the whole
tunnel was natural, only havinâ been hand-widened in three or four
places.

The fightinâ was goinâ on near the face oâ the cliff between us anâ
the mouth of the ravine; so we circled around until we caught sight of
âem. The first feller we made out was Mexican Slim; so we knew our
boys hadnât been ambushed up above, and this raised our spirits like a
balloon. We crept up until we could get good angle-shots, hid
ourselves, gave the old Diamond Dot yell, and began to shoot. Tyâs men
had been losinâ their bullet-appetite for some time, and they took us
to be genuwine reinforcements. They were well planted where they were,
but they started to retreat, and we crowded âem close.

Then it was that Ty made Olafâs word good: he exposed himself to
shots, he rallied his men, and that wolf-grin never left his face; but
still the tide had changed, and he had to go back with the rest. The
woman, with her hands tied behind her, was in charge oâ the Chink, who
was tall and heavy-set with a dark, evil, leathery face. He kept a
grin on his face, too, which reminded me most of a rattlesnake at
sheddinâ time. He used the woman as a shield, anâ this checked our
fire anâ kept us dodginâ for new positions. Still, all in all, this
part oâ the fight was about as satisfactory as any I ever took part
in.

Finally they retreated to the dip where the tunnel came out, and we
had to skirmish up the rocks to keep our vantage. Soon we discovered
that Ty had lost control of his men. He, Pepper Kendal, and two others
stood in the mouth oâ the tunnel, and took a few shots at us before
disappearinâ; but six of his men ran straight across the dip, and down
the other side toward the crick. Tillte Dutch was standinâ close to
me, and I asked him where the hosses were. He said they were tied
across the crick just above the upper ford; so I sent him for âem full
speed.

Horace and Tank stayed to watch the mouth oâ the openinâ, while the
rest of us wrangled the six Cross-branders through the cottonwoods.
They had a good start, and so had time to cut the wire and cross the
crick toward some broken land on the left. By this time Tillte had
tied the reins and thrown âem over the horns oâ the saddles so as to
lead a string, and he came lopinâ into view.

Slim, two oâ the Simpson boys, Olaf, and myself mounted and cut off
the six Cross-branders, who were too weary to even scatter. They had
had enough and surrendered. We tied their hands, and herded âem back
to the old shack, where Oscar, Spider, and three disabled
Cross-branders were runninâ a little private hospital. We fixed up
wounds as well as we could, sat the last six on a bench along the
wall, and left Dick Simpson to guard âem. Spider had been shot and cut
considâable; but he was able to stagger around some, while Oscar had
been punctured below the ribs, and things looked bad for him. Olaf had
been shot in the head, all right, just as The and I dove down the
stairway the night before, but his skull was bullet-proof, so nothinâ
came of it.

The Friar had been ransackinâ the locality, and had found one oâ the
Simpson boys dead, and one badly hurt. Badly crippled, as we were, we
didnât see any way to get at Ty except to starve him out. First off,
we made some coffee, and those who werenât hurt dangerous were given
some side-meat and corn bread; for, truth to tell, we were about once
through. We spent the afternoon under a tree half way between the
mouth oâ the tunnel, and the old cabin, so as to be handy in case we
were needed. After talkinâ it all over, we couldnât quite see why they
had split up, some of âem tryinâ to escape, and some stayinâ with Ty.

Finally I went to the cabin, durinâ a time the Friar was on watch at
the cave mouth, and picked out the weakest lookinâ of the prisoners. I
brought him down, and we tortured him with questions until he got
fuddled and told us that the two who had stuck to Ty had been so bad
hurt, they couldnât go any farther; but that neither Ty nor Pepper
were hurt to speak of.

The fact is, that in a general fight a feller loses his aim complete.
We had all aimed at Ty and Pepper the most, and here they were the two
not hurt at all. As darkness fell, the Friar couldnât hold himself in.
All afternoon he had done what he could for the wounded; but at
thought of the woman spendinâ another night in the cave with those
men, he became as wild-eyed as a bronc at his first brandinâ. Durinâ
the afternoon, Tank had stiffened until he couldnât do much travelinâ;
but I saw the Friar had his mind made up to take a plunge, so I tried
to fix things to prevent it.

Olaf, two oâ the Simpson boys, Promotheus, Tillte, Slim, Horace, and
myself lined up as beinâ still in workinâ order; but while he was in
the act of claiminâ to be all right, Slim doubled up in a faint, and
we found he had been bad hurt without even himself knowinâ of it; so
countinâ Horace who had two black eyes and a shot through the
fore-arm, theâ was seven of us able to get about purty nimble. Hid
away in the cave, somewhere, were Ty Jones, Pepper Kendal, and the
Chink, unhurt so far as we knew, and two others, still probably able
to help a little.

We placed a couple oâ logs againâ the fake drawers in the library, and
left Tank to take charge of the prisoners and the cabin. Then we
rustled up some tarps from the bunk-shack, and prepared to camp near
the openinâ with a man allus on guard, to prevent them from cominâ
outâand the Friar from goinâ in. We kept a lantern lit under shelter
of a rock, and made ready to rest up a bit.

I had told all the fellers to watch the Friar close, for he just
simply couldnât get the upper hand of himself. He tried his best to
simmer down and go to sleep, but every few minutes heâd boil over
again. I lay awake in my tarp watchinâ him for some time; but I was so
sore and weary myself I could scarcely recall what business I was on,
and first I knew I had drifted offâand been shook awake again.

Promotheus was bendinâ over me with the news âat the Friar had decided
to go into the tunnel, and they couldnât hold him back. I sprang up
and started for the opening with the rest following me. Dan Simpson
had relieved The on watch and when he found what was in the Friarâs
mind, he had crept down and told The, who had awakened the rest of us.

We reached the Friar, just as he was goinâ into the openinâ. I called
to him in a low tone; but he only shook his head. It was eleven
oâclock, and the shadow from the moon had already crept out from the
base oâ the cliff almost to the openinâ. I saw that the Friar had took
the bit; so I whispered to the others: âI am goinâ in there with him;
but more ân this would be bad. Weâd be in each otherâs way. Listen and
watch, but do not follow us in.â

âI know the way as well as you, and we could keep side by side,â sez
Promotheus; but I shook my head.

He came over to the openinâ and said in a low tone: âI havenât time to
make you understand; butâbut I just have to go in with you.â

âIf you come, the restâll come too,â sez I, exasperated.

âYou fellers stay here,â sez he to them in a pleadinâ tone; âbut I
have reasons. I just have to go in.â

So we shed our boots and started down the incline after the Friar,
Promotheus touchinâ my feet with his fingers at every step I crawled.
I didnât want to be there, I couldnât see how we could do any good;
but the Friar had made my world for me, such as it was, and I
understood better ân the rest what was gnawinâ at his heart; so I
hadnât any choice. I had to go in, and somethinâ inside Promotheus
drove him in also. The only crumb oâ comfort I could find, lay in the
fact that Horace had been winged, and so couldnât foller us, whether
he wanted to or not.




CHAPTER FORTY-TWO

HAND TO HAND


At first it was black as pitch; but I crawled as fast as I could in
the hope of catchinâ up with the Friar. It is instinct with most men
to follow the right wall when goinâ through a strange place in the
dark, though I never could see why. A man carries his weapon in the
right hand and naturally ought to be as free with it as possible.
Still, most men do it, so I follered the right wall, hopinâ each time
I put out my hand it would touch the Friar.

After a time, I saw a faint glimmer oâ light to the left, and I
stopped and pointed it out to The. We came to the conclusion that they
had a candle lighted in the offset where we had come upon the body,
and we discussed whether they were likely to be in there, or had gone
on farther back and left the light to see any one who tried to crawl
after âem. I held out âat they wouldnât expect any one to crawl after
âem; but The said âat Ty would be likely to go into just such a place
himself, and so would expect others to do the same. Ty certainly had
the way of impressinâ his own men.

When we got a little closer, I lay flat and scanned along the floor,
tryinâ to make out the Friar between me and the light; but I couldnât
see him, and we went on again. I hope I may never have to do any more
such work as this. Creepinâ along in the dark eats up a fellerâs nerve
like a forest fire.

When we got so close âat I could see my hands by the light, I sent The
across to the other side, remindinâ him to knock his teeth should he
chance upon the Friar, or in case we come together again, ourselves.

Then I lay flat with my hat down low, and nudged myself along with my
elbows and toes. I couldnât even make out The across the tunnel, which
was only about twelve feet wide, and just for the fraction of a second
it came across me that he had formerly been a Cross-brander, himself;
but this thought didnât live long enough to draw its second breath.

Finally I reached the spot where the light threw a splash on the walls
and floor, and I made my gun ready and stuck out my neck in what was
the most breathless silence I ever tried to listen to. Across the
splash oâ light in front of me, all was a solid wall oâ darkness; and
Iâd have paid over quite a sum to know what eyes were lookinâ out of
it.

Farther and farther I pushed myself into the light without seeinâ a
thing; until finally I saw the candle, itself, and beside itâthe
Friar.

I wriggled across the tunnel just as The crept into the room from his
side, and we felt a little better to be in the light, together again.
The body still lay againâ the wall, and The looked at the face; but he
didnât know it. The Friar hadnât seen or heard anything, either; and
we were up a tree to the top branches. We talked it all over, tryinâ
to imagine what we would do under the same circumstances, and finally
decided they had gone on down the tunnel, leavinâ a man on guard just
below the light, and that the man had gone to sleep.

âWell,â sez I after we had discussed things around in a circle for a
while, âhere we are holed up again, as cozy as a cavey oâ rats with
traps set at all the openinâs and en-thusiastic terrier dogs digginâ
down from above. If itâs not beinâ too inquisitive, Friar, what plan
did you have in cominâ down here?â

âI wanted to be close to her,â sez Friar Tuck. âI kept thinkinâ oâ how
lonely it must be for her through the dark, and I hoped theâ might be
some chance oâ helpinâ her to escape. I did not have any definite
planâonly faith and hope.â

âLike the shark which swallered the parasol,â sez I, for I was
considâable put out; âhe had faith in his digestion and hoped the
parasol was some new sort oâ health-food. But to get down to
factsâHave you any weapon with you, and are you willinâ to fight?â

âI have no weapon,â sez the Friar; âbut I am willinâ to do whatever
seems best. I am trusting in the same power which upheld Gideon, and I
ask to see no farther than he saw.â

This was the Friar all right, so I merely swallowed a couple oâ times
and didnât say anything. Whether he lived or died was the same to the
Friar, as whether he lived in Idaho or Montana would be to another
man; so I saved myself a certain amount of irritation by just thinkinâ
quietly as to what was best for us to try. Fact was, I didnât take, as
much stock in Gideon just then as I did in Ty Jones.

âIâll tell you what I think is best,â I sez after a bit; âfor me to
crawl down the hall in the hope that the watcher really has gone to
sleep; while you two stand ready in this offset. If they chase me,
Iâll run up the tunnel, and you spring out and take âem at a
disadvantage as they go by.â

Oâ course they both wanted to do the crawlinâ, but it was my plan, so
I stuck out for it, and started. I was really glad to be out oâ the
light again, and I crawled as gentle as though crossinâ a bridge of
eggs. Before long my fingers struck a boot, and I felt of it
ex-treme-lee careful. If ever I go blind, my experience durinâ those
days will help considâable in transferrinâ my eyesight to my fingers.

The feller had toppled over againâ the right wall, and I crept up
alongside, holdinâ my gun by the barrel, and ready to swat his head as
soon as I had located it; but theâ was no useâthe man had already
died. He had been shot twice, but they thought he could last a while
on guard, and this was why we had been able to cross the lighted
place.

Just beyond this, I came upon another offset, on the opposite side
from where the candle was. We hadnât noticed it that morninâ âcause we
had gone out along the other wall. I heard some heavy breathinâ in
here; but I also heard some one tossinâ about anâ mutterinâ, and I
hardly dared risk an examination. I looked back at the splash of
light, and it seemed mighty cheery and sociable, compared with the
darkness and company I was in.

Itâs astonishinâ the way pictures fly across a fellerâs mind at such a
time: I saw the boy down at the foot of the stairs, I saw him as he
must have been, a few years before some quick, rash deed of his had
drawn a veil across the laughter in his eyes; I saw the feller in the
offset, and wondered how much it had taken to turn the expression of
his face into that beastlike hunger for revenge, and then dozens of
schemes and plans for capturinâ Ty began to flash upon me; but each
time, the presence of the woman spoiled everything. They had used her
for a shield once, they would do it again, and I couldnât see a way to
get around her.

We knew âat Ty had vowed he would never be taken alive; and I couldnât
see what we would do with him even if we did take him alive; but I
could see that he would take pleasure in dragginâ as big a bunch into
the next world with him as possible, and yet every scheme âat came to
me was blocked by the presence of the woman. Finally I crept a little
way into the offset. My hand touched a piece of cloth, I felt over it
with nothinâ except the ridges on my fingers touchinâ; but just when I
made sure it was the Chink, he moved and sat up. I stopped breathinâ;
but after a minute, he sighed and settled back.

I waited a little longer and then crawled back and told what I had
discovered. âIf theâ was only some way we could throw a light into
that offset,â sez I, âI think we could fix âem.â

We studied over this for some time before the Friar thought up a way
which seemed worth tryinâ. I said Iâd go back and stay at the far side
oâ the openinâ, and when they brought the rope back, to come right on
with it along the left wall, and Iâd knock my teeth together to show
it was meâprovided I was still there and able. So the Friar pulled
off his boots, and The kept watch in the offset while the Friar ran
back. I thought it must be several days since weâd come in, but he
looked at his watch before startinâ, and it was only two oâclock.

From where I was, I could make out the shape oâ the feller they had
put on watch, and knew I could keep cases on all within the little
rock room. After an age, I saw two forms creep like ghosts out of the
dark beyond the candle, and ooze into the offset without makinâ a
sound. Then in a moment, Promotheus came stealinâ along the wall with
the end of the rope. I made my signal to him, and he went on down the
tunnel, slowly pullinâ the rope after him.

I was mighty curious to see how they had fixed the lantern, which they
were to light with the candle in the offset, and it made me feel a lot
better when it came out of the recess. Horace had done the fixinâ, I
afterward found out, and it had nearly broke his heart not to come in
with it; but he realized that it was necessary to have an outer guard,
so he had stayed with the two Simpson boys. He had put the lantern
into a box after nailinâ a couple oâ short pieces of rope on the
bottom for runners; and now it came slidinâ along without makinâ a
sound. He had sawed a piece out of the side, so that all the light
came up againâ the ceilinâ, and onto the side where the openinâ was.

Slowly it came along, and I stood in the shadow watchinâ it. Finally
it fell on the face of the man lyinâ near the openinâ, and I saw he
was one of those who had been at Skeltyâs that nightâfor all I know,
it was his hand I had seen raisinâ the window to my room. Next, it
lighted up the openinâ, itself; and then The stopped pullinâ and crept
up opposite me. We heard âem sighinâ and groaninâ, in the recess, and
finally the womanâs voice gave a weary moan as she came awake.

In a second, Tyâs voice was heard, askinâ what was the matter; and we
all braced up our nerves. A weak, delirious voice started to babble,
but it was broken by a shot, and a bullet ripped through the box, but
without puttinâ out the light. I started across the hall; but The had
already seen it, and had taken the rope and ran down the tunnel with
it. He turned the box, so âat just the left edge oâ the light touched
the openinâ, and then came across to my side. We werenât in a black
shadow now; but still, with the light in their faces, it would have
been hard to see us.

A hand reached out of the openinâ, and fired in our direction, I
dropped to my knee and aimed at the hand, but neither shot counted;
and for the next few minutes, all we heard was that weak voice,
babblinâ indistinctly. It hadnât worked out as I thought it would. I
figured that theyâd be surprised when the light shone in their faces,
and would rush out and give us a chance. Now that it was too late, I
thought up half a dozen better schemes.

Even while I was thinkinâ up a perfect one, I saw a form come out from
the recess, and threw my gun upâbut I didnât snap the hammer. It was
the woman, and behind her I could make out the shaved head oâ the
Chinaman.

We all stayed silent for some time, anâ then Tyâs voice said: âWell,
what kind of a settlement do you fellers want?â

He spoke as self-composed as though puttinâ through a beef-dicker, and
no reply was made for several seconds. Then, as no one else spoke, I
sez: âAll we want is just the woman and whatâs left oâ your outfit,
Ty.â

âWhoâs that speakinâ?â sez Ty.

âHeâs generally called Happy Hawkins, Ty,â sez I.

âWhoâs in charge oâ your gang?â sez he.

âDinky Bradford,â sez I after thinkinâ a moment; âbut Iâm delegated to
speak for him.â

âTell ya what Iâll do,â sez Ty; âIâll trade ya the woman for Dinky
Bradford anâ the Singinâ Parson. Send those two in to me, and Iâll
send her out to you.â

This was the foolest proposition ever I heard of. The woman wouldnât
âaâ been any use to us without the Friar. âDinky Bradford is guardinâ
the mouth oâ the tunnel,â sez I; âbut he wouldnât stand for any such
nonsense, nohow.â

âIs the preacher here?â asked Ty.

âYes, I am here,â sez the Friar, steppinâ out from the offset and
cominâ toward us. Olaf, who was with him, caught his arm and kept him
from exposinâ himself.

âDamn you,â sez Ty, slow anâ deliberate. âI hate you worse ân any man
in this territory. Youâre at the bottom of all this kick-up. Youâre
the one which has turned my own men againâ me; and all I ask is a
chance to settle it out with you.â

âYouâre mistaken if you think that I advised this method,â began the
Friar; but Ty broke in, and said: âNever mind any oâ that
preacher-talk. I know whatâs what, and Iâm all prepared to have you
hide behind your religion, after havinâ started all the trouble. Iâll
offer you a plan which any man would acceptâbut I donât class you as
a man. The fair way to settle this would be for the men who are with
us to empty their guns anâ lay âem on the floor, then you and me strip
to the waist anâ fight it out with knives. They havenât anything at
stake; but I suppose youâll be true to your callinâ, and make them
take all the risk.â

âI want to be true to my callinâ,â sez the Friar; âand fightinâ with
knives isnât part oâ my callinâ.â

Ty laughed as mean as a man ever did laugh; and both Olaf and I
offered to take the Friarâs place; but Ty said he didnât have anything
special againâ us any more ân heâd have againâ the Friarâs ridinâ
hoss; and then he offered to fight the Friar and Dinky Bradford at the
same time.

He kept on roastinâ the Friar till I bet I was blushinâ; but the Friar
just stood out straight in the gloom oâ the tunnel and shook his head
no. Then the woman took a half step forward, anâ the Chink jerked her
back, twistinâ her wrist and makinâ her give a smothered scream.

I had moved the box around to give us a little more light; and when
she screamed, I saw the blood rush up the Friarâs pale face to his
eyes, where it burst into flame. Livinâ fire it was, and in a flash it
had burned away his religion, his scruples againâ violence, the whole
outer shell oâ civilization, and left him just a male human with his
woman in the power of another. âStrip,â he said, and his words rolled
down the tunnel like a growl of a grizzly. âStrip, and fight for your
life, for I intend to destroy you.â

I can still hear the laugh Ty gave when the Friar said this. âDestroy
me?â he said. âDestroy me? Thatâs a good one! Now, do your men agree
to let us go free if I win?â

âI do,â sez The.

âI do,â said I, after Iâd taken another look at the Friar, who was
already unbuttoninâ his shirt.

âI doâif you fight fair,â said Olaf slowly.

âThen one of ya hold the lantern while we empty the guns,â said Ty.

I didnât like this part of it; but couldnât see any way out; so while
The held the lantern, one on each side emptied a gun and tossed it to
the center of the tunnel. We emptied all of ours, and they emptied all
of theirs, and then while Ty was takinâ off his shirt, I went up to
the Friar. When I saw the taut muscles ripplinâ beneath his white
skin, I felt comforted; but when I saw him holdinâ his knife point
down, the way they do in the picture-books, I got worried again.

âTake your knife the other way, Friar,â I whispered; âand strike up
under the floatinâ ribs on his left side. Thatâs the way to his
heart.â

âI know how to fight with a knife,â he snapped; so I didnât say any
more. Horace had become a gun-fighter, here was the Friar claiminâ to
know the knife game, and if the woman had stepped out and challenged
the winner to a fight with stones, why, I was so meek I wouldnât âaâ
got het up over it.

Then Ty Jones came out of the other offset, stripped to the waist also
and holdinâ his knife in his left hand. The woman had gone into the
niche on our side, me anâ Olaf leaned againâ our wall, Pepper Kendal
and the Chink leaned againâ the wall opposite us, The held up the
lantern, and for a full minute the only sound was the wounded
Cross-brander, babblinâ out his delirium back in the cave-room.

Ty was a shade beefier ân the Friar; but his skin was dull, and the
muscles didnât cut off into the tendons so sharp, nor they didnât seem
quite so springy or well oiled; but there was half a dozen knife scars
on his chest, and he had come up our way from Mexico.

They walked toward each other, Tyâs eagle eyes anâ wolf-grin tryinâ to
beat down the grim set to the Friarâs face. They both crouched over
anâ circled about each other like a pair oâ big cats. Ty made a few
lunges, but the Friar parried âem as simple as though it was a game,
and purty soon Ty was forced to slip his knife to his right hand with
the blade pointinâ up for a rip. When he did this, the Friar smiled,
turned his own knife the same way; and I recalled the Friar havinâ
told me about learninâ knife tricks from an I-talian he had helped
back East.

I donât like knife fightinâ, and I donât approve of it; but I will say
âat this fight was the cleanest, quickest thing I ever saw. The Friar
was the best man, but Ty was the best posted; and time and again the
Friar saved himself by foot work. The follered âem close with his
lantern, while Olaf and I kept a half watch on the two opposite us.

They kept movinâ faster and faster and theâ was a continuous spattinâ
as they parried with their left hands. Finally the Friar grabbed Ty by
the wrist, Ty grabbed the Friarâs wrist at the same time, lowered his
head, and butted the Friar in the pit oâ the stomach. It looked bad;
but the Friar had raised his knee and caught Ty on the chin; so they
staggered apart and breathed deep for a minute, before beginninâ
again.

The grin had left Tyâs face, and it had settled into black hate. When
they began again, the Friar seized Tyâs wrist every chance he got,
twistinâ it, bendinâ the arm, and tryinâ to thrust with his knife; but
Ty was tough and wiry, and managed to twist out every time. At last
the Friar caught Tyâs right wrist, dropped his own knife, ran his head
under Tyâs right arm, caught the slack of his right pant leg, gave a
heave and threw him over his head. It was a clean throw and the Friar
stooped, picked up his knife and started for Ty before he had time to
get to his feet. Ty rolled to his feet and dodged away as though to
run, whirled, took the blade of his knife between thumb and
forefinger, and spun it through the air. It struck the Friarâs
collarbone, cut a gash through his shoulder, and twanged againâ the
wall oâ the tunnel.

The two men eyed each other for a moment, the calm of victory in the
Friarâs eyes, the red of baffled hate in Tyâs. They were about eight
feet apart. âWill you give up?â asked the Friar.

âNo,â sez Ty. He doubled up his fists as though to spring, then
whirled and stepped into the offset behind him. In a moment, he came
out with a gun in his hand.

As soon as he had said no, Pepper Kendal anâ the Chink had made a dive
for the offset, and Olaf and I had made a dive for them. I got Pepper
who was old and stiff, and I managed to hit him in the center oâ the
forehead just as Ty came out with his gun. Olaf was havinâ trouble
with the Chink, and I picked up a gun and tapped Pepper on the head
with it, and then turned to knock the Chink. Just as I turned, I saw
the woman walkinâ slowly down the tunnel behind the Friar, and I saw
Ty bend his gun on him. Even then he had to pause a moment to enjoy
his deviltry, and I still see that picture in my dreamsâthe Friar
standinâ silent and proud, with his head thrown back and his level
eyes full on Ty, while back of him stood the woman as unconcerned as a
snow-bird. About six feet beyond âem stood Promotheus holdinâ the
light above his head, while his face seemed frozen with horror.

For an instant they stood like stone images. Then The lunged forward
and caught Tyâs arm, the lantern went out, I heard one clear report,
and one muffled one, and then I started for âem. I bumped into a heavy
form, two naked arms went around me in a bear-grip, and we rolled to
the floor. The candle in our offset had burned out; but I knew it was
the Friar, âcause his was the only smooth face among us. âThis is
Happy,â I muttered, and we rose to our feet.

A struggle was goinâ on beyond us, and I thought it was Olaf and the
Chink; so I lit a match, knowinâ that Ty would âaâ had plenty oâ time
to get away already. As the match burned up, I saw the Chink lyinâ
stretched out, and Olaf and Ty locked together. Olaf had his leg
wrapped around Tyâs, and was bendinâ his back. Tyâs eyes were stickinâ
out white anâ gruesome, and he was gurglinâ in the throat. Suddenly,
somethinâ cracked and they both fell to the floor oâ the tunnel just
as the match went out.

I heard hard breathinâ, and then Olafâs harsh voice came out oâ the
darkness. âWell,â he said, âI guess that squares things.â

âWhatâs happened, whatâs happened?â asked a panting voice, and then I
knew âat Horace hadnât been able to stand it any longer, and had come
in, game wing and all.

âWeâve settled up with Ty Jonesâthatâs whatâs happened,â said Olaf;
and as we stood there in the gloom, the drip oâ the dawn came rollinâ
cold and gray down the slant oâ the tunnel; and I shuddered and turned
away to find somethinâ for my hands to do.




CHAPTER FORTY-THREE

THE GIFT OF THE DAWN


The first thing I did was to light the lantern, for the daylight which
came down there was too much in keepinâ with the conditions to suit
me. Promotheus was doubled up anâ holdinâ his side; so the first thing
I did was to ask him if he was bad hurt. Theâ was a smile on his lips,
a regular satisfied, self-composed smile, but I didnât just like the
look in his eyes.

âNope, I donât ache at all, Happy,â he said in a firm voice; âbut I
canât move much. Tend to the others first.â

It seems âat Tyâs first shot had hit the woman in the head, and his
next had got The in the sideâbut The had managed to get the gun away
from him, which is why the rest of us were spared.

The Friar had carried the woman into our offset, and was rubbinâ her
wrists and workinâ over her, though theâ didnât appear to be much use.
She was still alive; but that was just all, so I left them and
examined the rest. Ty was all twisted out oâ shape, and lay with his
eyes open, glassy anâ stary and horrible. Olaf hadnât had time to
quite finish the Chink, and he was crawlinâ down the tunnel when I
nabbed him. Then Horace took the lantern while Olaf and I hog-tied
Pepper Kendal and the Chink.

We next examined the cave-room where Ty had made his last stand. It
was fair-sized anâ well stocked, and also had half a dozen extra guns
in it. When I saw these fresh guns, I gave a low whistle to think what
a lot oâ suckers weâd been to discard our own trumps and set in a game
against a marked deck; but as the Friar allus said: âWrong feeds on
death and Right feeds on life; so theâ canât be no doubt as to the
final result, even though things do look blue sometimes.â

There was a fine spring in the corner oâ this roomâthe same spring
which afterwards came out near the mouth of the ravine and was piped
into the old cabin. The wounded Cross-brander was still babblinâ, so
we fed him some water and eased him around a little.

Next we went outside and nailed some pieces to a couple oâ light
poles, and we were mighty glad to have enough left to man this vehicle
when it was finished, for we were all purt nigh used up, Tillte, the
two Simpson boys, and myself carried the litter, while Horace ran the
illumination, and Olaf tended to Pepper and the Chink.

We took âem all out, even to the dead; and the one at the foot of the
stairs turned out to be the boy, just as Iâd thought. Next to the
woman, with the Friar walkinâ beside her his head on his breast, this
trip with the boy cut me worse ân any. Promotheus got off three
average good jokes while we were packinâ him out, and cheered us up a
lot; but we put Ty Jones down with the dead. As we straightened him
out he gave a groan which made us all jump. The whole thing had become
a nightmare, and we staggered about like the ingredients of a dream.

The womanâs head was shattered on top anâ theâ wasnât any hope for
her; but still, it gave the Friar comfort to work over her, so we
acted as though we thought she had a chance. The nearest doctor was at
Meltnerâs stage station, a full dayâs ride. Tillte went after him,
while Dan Simpson rode over to his fatherâs to break the news and
bring back Kit. What with the prisoners still on our hands, the dead
to bury, and the wounded to wait on, we were in chin-deep; and the
worst of it was, âat we didnât want the news to get out. We had tried
to settle things without botherinâ the law, and we preferred to finish
that way if possible.

We buried the four Cross-branders across the crick and down stream
from the lower ford, and we buried Tim Simpson just a little way above
the upper ford. The Friar went along and helped dig the graves and
carry them to it; but he didnât preach nor sing, and his face was
drawn with sorrow.

By eveninâ we had got things to some system. Spider, Tank, Slim, and
Horace were able to help quite a little; but Oscar, Tom Simpson, and
Promotheus were in bad shape; while we had seven prisoners, countinâ
the Chink, and seven wounded enemies to look after. The feller Horace
had shot, up on top, got out oâ the country, I reckon. Anyway they
left him above with the horses, and we never heard of him again.

Olâ man Simpson, Kit, and the boy arrived durinâ the moonlight, and we
were all mighty glad to see Kit, though we hated to face the old man.
Still, he was game, and took it mighty well. Tillte had got a fresh
hoss at Meltnerâs and had started right back with the doctor; so they
arrived a little after seven next morninâ. The doctor was purty young
lookinâ to me; but he had a bagful oâ shiny instruments, and he made
himself at home without any fuss. He had been in a Colorado hospital
for two years, a mininâ hospital, and he was as familiar with a
fellerâs insides, as a pony is with the range he was foaled on. He had
took a claim near Meltnerâs, and was able to talk a long time on why
it was better for a young doctor to come west.

He praised the Friarâs work to the skiesâand then turned in and did
it all over to suit himself. He said that all the wounded stood a good
show except the woman, Promotheus, and Ty Jones. We none of us thought
âat The was in much danger; but the doctor shook his head. Tyâs spinal
column had been unjointed near the base, and he was paralyzed from the
hips down; but in all that skirmishinâ, he was the only one who hadnât
lost a drop oâ blood. The Friar, himself, had two flesh-wounds beside
the one Ty had give him.

I was with the doctor when he started to work on the womanâs head; but
I couldnât stand it. Iâm not overly squeamish; but I own up I couldnât
stand this; so I backed out, leavinâ the Friar with his face like
chalk, to hand instruments while little old Kit held a basin. I hated
to leave âem; but I didnât take a full breath until I was beside
Promotheus again.

His voice had got weaker, but the smile never left his lips, and it
was restful just to sit and watch him. Horace hovered over him like a
young hen, and The drank so much water, simply to please Horace, that
I feared his bones would dissolve. Horace had told the doctor he would
pay all the bills, and to go the full limit and not try to economize
none on his patch-work. We put the seven prisoners in the workshop,
and slept in tarps around the door, which was fastened with a chain,
so âat if they got it open, a board would fall on these sleepinâ next,
and wake âem.

The Friar was all for notifyinâ the authorities; but old man Simpson
had been a notorious public, or some such official, back in Vermont
and naturally he was up on all the twists and windinâs of the law. He
said it would take the Su-preme Court itself fifteen years to sift out
the actual legalities of our tangle; and even then he wasnât sure
which side would get the worst of it, so he advised us to just work it
out on our own hook, which we had decided to do anyway.

For three days, the woman lay in a stupor. Kit had told me that her
skull hadnât been actually shatteredâthat she had been shot in just
about the same way that Olaf had, but that Nature had counted on Olaf
gettinâ into some such a fix, and had provided for it by givinâ him a
flint skull, while the womanâs skull wasnât of much use except in
times of peace. Kit said the doctor had taken out a few splinters of
bone, and had fastened up the openinâ, but had said theâ wasnât any
show for her.

On the other hand, Olaf had looked at her careful, and had said that
all the vital part of her was workinâ on just this point. He said that
the light about her body was the blue oâ weakness; but that just at
this point, theâ was a constant bulginâ out oâ different colors in a
way he had never before seen. The doctor heaved up his eyebrows at
Olafâs verdict, and looked as though he thought perhaps Olafâs brain
had been shifted a little out oâ line, in spite of his flint skull.

On the third night I was what the doctor called his orderly, and went
on duty at midnight. I was sittinâ out on the porch of the old cabin
when the Friar came out holdinâ his hand across his eyes. We had moved
the wounded men over to the bunk-shack, and the woman was in Tyâs
bedroom. I didnât speak to him, and he stood leaninâ against one oâ
the posts for some time without seeinâ me.

He trembled all over, and his breath came quick and catchy. Finally he
looked up at the stars and said in a low tone, as though speakinâ
personal to some one near at hand: âSave me, oh God, from mockery! I
have spoken for others in my vanity; and now that my own hour has
come, oh save me from the rebellion of my flesh; and give me grace to
say in my heart, Thy will be done.â

As he stood with his face upraised, the late moon crept out and shone
full upon it, and the agony in it struck me like a blow; but even as I
looked, the change came. Before my very eyes, I saw the sign of peace
made upon the Friarâs brow. A moment before and it had been torn into
wrinkles and covered with beads of sweat; but now it was smooth and
calm. He clasped his hands across his breast, closed his eyes, and
theâ came a smile to his lips which drew a mist to my own eyes. I
canât be absolutely certain of it, because oâ this blur in my eyes;
but I think, I actually and honestly do think, that I saw white forms
hoverinâ in the moonlight above him.

He drew a full breath and turned to go in, but saw me settinâ with my
back againâ the wall oâ the cabin, and came over and put a hand on my
shoulder. I couldnât say anything. I wanted to say somethinâ to
comfort him; but I couldnât speak a word, until he asked me how the
others were gettinâ along. I told him they were all doinâ fine, and
that even Ty had been restinâ well. He turned to go in, and then I
found the nerve to ask him how things were inside.

âIt is all over, Happy,â sez he, without even a catch in his voice.
âJust before I came out here, the doctor said the pulse had stopped.â

He caught his breath with a little gasp at this; but that was all.
âWhat did Olaf say?â I asked.

âOlaf says that she still lives,â he answered; âbut I fear that Olaf
is not to be relied upon this time. He has a strange gift; but he does
not understand it himself, and while I know he would not deceive me, I
feel that the doctor must know best.â

âWell, Iâll not give up until Olaf does!â I blurted.

He smiled again and put his hand back on my shoulder. âCome in and
look at her,â he said, âshe is very beautiful. The strange mask has
fallen from her face, and she is once more as she was in those old,
happy days when we walked together through our own Garden of Eden.
Come in, I want you to see her.â

I went in with him, though I didnât want to. I knew what love did to a
man, and that I hadnât seen the same woman he had; but theâ was
another face allus before my eyes, and no one else was beautiful to
me. I didnât want to do any pertendinâ to the Friar, even at such a
time as this.

I follered him inside, feelinâ out oâ place and embarrassed; but when
I looked down at the quiet face in the bed, I was glad I had come. She
didnât look like the same woman, not at all. All the weary, puzzled
expression had left her face, and in spite of its whiteness, it looked
like the face of a girl. I looked at her a long time and the thought
that came to me over and over was, what a shame she couldnât have had
just a few words with the Friar before she was called on; just a few
words, now that her right mind was back.

After a time I looked up. Kit sat near the head of the bed, leaninâ
over and holdinâ a handkerchief to her eyes, Olaf sat near her, a
strange, grim set to his lips. His head was bandaged and he looked
less like a human than usual, as he kept his eyes fixed on the white
face oâ the woman. Theâ was a lamp on the stand and I could see his
eyes. Blue they were, deep blue, like the flowers on the benches in
June, and they didnât move; but kept a steady gaze upon the white,
still face. The doctor sat in a corner, his eyes on the floor. At
first I thought he was asleep, and goodness knows, he was entitled to
it; but just as I looked at him he rubbed his fingers together a
moment and stood up.

He walked over and put his hand on the Friarâs shoulder. âYou might as
well all go to sleep, now,â he said, gently. âThere is nothing more to
do.â

âAre you positive?â asked the Friar.

âPositive,â said the doctor. âThere is no heart action, and when I
held a mirror to her lips no vapor was formed.â

âShe is still alive,â said the deep voice of Olaf, and we all gave a
little start.

The doctor took a silver quarter and held it to the womanâs nose for a
minute, and then looked at it. A puzzled look came to his face, and he
went back and sat down in the corner again.

âWas it discolored?â asked the Friar.

âNo,â sez the doctor slowly; âbut I am sure there is no life
remaining. I have seen several cases of suspended animation, but
nothinâ like this.â

âShe lives, and the light is getting stronger,â said Olaf.

Kit took the handkerchief from her eyes which were still full oâ
tears. She wiped them away, and looked first at the woman and then at
Olaf, and then she gave a sigh. The Friarâs hands were opening and
shutting. He had fought his fight out on the porch; but the suspense
was beginninâ to undermine him again.

I went back to the porch and stayed a while. When I went in again,
they were all as I had left them; and after a few minutes I made my
rounds, found everything all right, and came back. I went into the
room several times, and just as I caught the first whiff oâ the dawn
breeze, I went in once more, determined to coax the Friar to lie down
and try to sleep.

They were still in the same positions. Not a line had changed in the
womanâs face, the Friar was almost as white as she was but still stood
at the foot oâ the bed lookinâ down at her; while the wrinkles on
Olafâs set face seemed carved in stone.

I had just put my hand on the Friarâs arm to get his attention when
Olaf rose to his feet, pressed his hand to his blinkinâ eyes, and said
wearily: âThe blue color is givinâ way to pink. She will get well.â

âDonât say it unless youâre sure!â cried the Friar, his voice like a
sob.

For answer Olaf pointed down at the womanâs face. A faint color stole
into her cheeks, and as we looked her eyes opened. The first thing
they rested upon was the Friarâs face bent above her, and her lips
parted in a wonderinâ smileâa smile which lighted her face like the
morninâ sun on olâ Mount Savage, and made her beautiful, to me anâ to
all whoâve ever seen her.

âIs it you?â she whispered. âIs it really you?â

A warm, rosy beam of sunshine slipped in through the window and fell
across the bed, and the rest of us tiptoed out, leavinâ the Friar
alone with the gift of life which the Dawn had brought back to him.




CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR

TY JONES NODS HIS HEAD


It was a week after this before Olaf could see properly again. The
doctor was wild to take Olaf back East and hold doinâs with him; but
Olaf wouldnât listen to it. He hated to have people take him for a
freak, and said it wasnât any fault of his that he saw the way he did.
The doctor said âat what Olaf saw was called the aurora; he said that
science had been tryinâ to locate it, but hadnât found any way to do
it, and that it was some sort oâ rays shootinâ out from this which had
put the inflammation into Olafâs eyes.

Olaf had had one of his teeth filled when he was young, and ever since
that heâd been suspicious oâ science; so he just clouded up his face
when they tried to devil him into beinâ an experiment, and they
couldnât do anything with him. The Friar might have been able to, but
the Friar would have sent his own eyes East by freight before heâd
have asked Olaf to do a single thing he didnât want to do. The
ignorant allus scoff at the idee of Olaf seeinâ the soul-flame; but
the edicated allus take a serious interest which seems mighty
funnyâdonât it?

From the very moment Janet opened her eyes and smiled up at the Friar
that morninâ she continued to improve. The doctor listened to all that
was told him about her havinâ pains in the top of her head and not
beinâ right intellectually, and he said she must have had a blow there
at some former time which had probably formed a tumor on the brain or
knocked off a few splinters of bone into it, and that in removinâ the
pressure, she had been put into perfect order again.

She had the smoothest voice I had ever heard, and I just doted on
hearinâ her speak the Friarâs name, John Carmichael. I had a legal
right to use the name John, myself; but it allus had the feel of a
stiff collar to me, so I was glad enough to have it forgotten. But
when Janet spoke the words John Carmichael, why, it cleared up the
atmosphere and started a little breeze. She didnât recall how she had
come to Cross Crick, nor anything much which had happened to her since
the night in Berlin. She said she had took singinâ lessons in a place
called Italy, and had expected to reach grand opery.

She had sung for pay whenever she got a chance, in order to get money
enough to go on with her studies, and was gettinâ what Iâd call mighty
lucrative wages at the Winter Garden; but was all the time bothered by
a lot oâ foreign dudes who had the desire to make love, but not the
capacity. She said her manager had introduced an Austrian count for
advertizinâ purposes, and she had finally consented to eat a meal with
him; but had been taken sick and had fallen. This was when she had
bumped her head and she never got clear in it again until that morning
when she had hovered between goinâ out with the night or cominâ back
with the dawn.

She said she had a hazy, dreamlike remembrance of havinâ tried all
kinds oâ work after this; but couldnât tell the real from the unreal;
and she didnât have any recollection of how she had come to the ranch.
We never mentioned Ty Jones to her for she was cominâ along like a
colt on grass, and we didnât want to risk any set-back. She said she
still had it on her mind that she had lost something precious; but she
couldnât make out what it could have been, and the Friar allus told
her not to worry, but to just rest herself back to complete strength.

Oscar and Tom Simpson had turned the corner, and it was only a
question of time when theyâd be all right againâwhich was true of all
the others except Ty and Prometheus. Ty wouldnât speak to us at all,
though he didnât seem to suffer to amount to anything. The doctor said
he might live for years, or he might slip away at a momentâs notice;
but either way, he was doomed to be paralyzed for the rest of his
life; while theâ wasnât any hope for Promotheus at all.

He had been shot through the liver, which pleased him a lot as beinâ
so in keepinâ with his name; but we couldnât see why a feller who had
survived beinâ shot in so many other places, should have to give in on
account of an extra hole in his liver. Horace divided his time between
waitinâ on The and spurrinâ up the doctor to try some new treatment.
He read aloud to The out oâ Tyâs books, and he seemed as fond oâ those
old Greek fellers as Horace was himself. He was also mighty pleased to
have the Friar read and talk to him, and it softened us all a lot to
see how patient and gentle Promotheus had become. Humanity is about
the finest thing theâ is about a human; and all humans have a showinâ
growth of it, if ya can just scratch the weeds away and give it a
chance.

The prisoners bothered us a heap; we feared they might have some
leaninâs toward revenge; so we didnât dare turn âem loose until they
showed some decided symptoms of repentance. Finally we got to bringinâ
âem up two at a time to talk with The. At first it didnât do any good,
as Ty sat propped up in a bunk, grinninâ scornful, while The lay flat
on his back lookinâ mighty weak and wan; but after several trials at
it, they seemed to pay more heed to what The told âem. We figured that
Ty must have ten or a dozen men still out on the range somewhere; but
they never showed up.

In about two weeks, or it might âaâ been three, all the wounded were
able to walk about except Promotheus, Ty Jones, and Oscar. Oscar was
doinâ fine; but the noise of the other men bothered The a little at
night, though he denied it up and down. Still, we thought best to move
him and Ty to a couple oâ cots at the east end of the mess-hall, which
was large and airy, with a big fireplace for cool nights. By this time
Janet was able to take short walks, leaninâ on the Friarâs arm; but
the Friar hadnât come any closer to findinâ out what it was she had
lost, nor whether or not she was Tyâs wife. The only reply Ty ever
made to questions, was to skin back his lips in a wolf-grin.

The used to lay with his eyes fixed on Tyâs face and a look of
hopeless sadness in his own. When weâd come and talk to him, his face
would light up; but as soon as we left him, he would look at Ty again
with a sorrow that fair wrung a fellerâs heart. I wanted to separate
âem; but when I suggested this to The, he shook his head. âNope,â he
said, âhe may speak to me before the vultures finish with my liver;
and if ever the mood crosses his mind for a second, I want to be so
handy âat he wonât have time to change his mind.â

I told The âat what was worryinâ the Friar most was that all the
fightinâ had been on his account; but that next to this, it was
because he didnât know whether or not Ty was married to Janet.

That eveninâ just when the thinky time oâ twilight came along, I was
settinâ by the fire in the mess-hall, where I could see Ty, and his
face didnât have quite so much the eagle look to it as common. Theâs
eyes rested on Tyâs face most oâ the time, and he, too, noticed it
beinâ a little less fierce than usual.

âTy,â he said in a low tone, âI was drove into turninâ againâ ya. Not
by force, ya understand, nor by fear; but by something which has crept
into me durinâ the last few years, and which I canât understand,
myself. Horace and the Friar have been mighty good to meâthey saved
my life, ya know, after I had forfeited it by raidinâ âem durinâ the
night. I told âem I wouldnât be a spy on you about anything else
except the woman. You havenât much excuse to bear me any ill will,
seeinâ as it was your own hand which shot the move-on order into me.
Iâm goinâ to slip out yonder before long; but theâs no knowinâ how
long youâll have to sit penned up in a chair.â

Theâs voice gave out here, and he stopped a few minutes to cough. Tyâs
face hadnât changed, and his eyes looked out through the south window
to where the western sky was still lighted into glory by the rays oâ
the sun, which had already sunk.

âIâve been locked up in a stone prison, Ty,â said Promotheus as soon
as he had quieted down again; âand I want to tell you that the minutes
drag over ya like a spike-tooth harrow, when you havenât nothinâ to
look at but four gray walls and the pictures on your memory. A feller
feeds himself on bitter recollections in order to keep his hate lusty;
but all this pilinâ up oâ hate is just one parchinâ hot day after
anotherâlike weâve had this summer. Everything green and pleasant in
a fellerâs nature is burned down to the roots, and in tryinâ to hate
all the world, he ends by hatinâ himself worst of all. Every kindly
deed heâs done seems like a soothinâ shower, and counts a lot in
keepinâ him from fallinâ down below the level oâ snakes and coyotes.

âIâm not preachinâ at ya, Iâm tellinâ you just what I know to be so
from actual experience. I donât bear you no ill will, Ty, whether you
tell me what I want to know, or not; but you have it in your power to
give me more content than airy other man in all the world. Are you
married to the woman, Ty?â

For a moment Ty didnât move, and then his lips tightened and he nodded
his head. Promotheus gave a sigh and settled back. He stayed quiet for
some time and then said in a weak voice: âThank ya, Ty. Iâm purty
certain that at such a time as this, you wouldnât deceive me. Iâm
sorry you are married to herâon the Friarâs account, understandâbut
Iâm mightily obliged to you for tellinâ me the truth. The Friar is a
square man, and heâs a strong man. Heâll be able to fight what he has
to fight; but none of us can fight uncertainty, without losinâ our
nerve in the end. I wish you would talk to me, Ty. I thought more oâ
you than of airy other man I ever knew, except Horace and the Friar;
and I wish, just for old timeâs sake, youâd talk to me a little before
I slip away. You can talk, canât ya?â

âYes, I can talk,â sez Ty Jones, facinâ The with a scowl; âbut I
havenât any talk I want to waste on traitors. If I was to speak at
all, it would be to ask âem to separate me from your sloppy yappinâ.
You may think âat you sound as saintly as a white female angel when
you whine about duty and forgiveness and such-like rubbish; but the
more oil you put on your voice, the more I know you to be a sneak, a
hypocrite, and a traitor. I wonât ask âem to move me; because Iâm not
in the habit of _askinâ_ any man. When I had two legs to stand
on, I gave orders. Now that I canât give orders, I donât speak at all;
but every time you try to speak like a hen-missionary, you can know
that Iâm sayinâ to myselfâsneak, hypocrite, traitor!â

One thing youâll have to say about Ty Jones, anâ that is, that when he
started north, he didnât wobble off to the east or west much, let what
would come in his path. The only reply The made was to sigh; but what
I wanted to do, was to lull Promotheus into a deep sleep, and then to
fasten Ty Jonesâs neck to a green bronco, and let them two settle it
out between âem which was the tougher beast. What I did do, was to
steal out and tell Horace what had been said, and I also told him not
to separate Ty and Promotheus as I thought The would set him an
example which might finally soften him a little and make him more fit
to die, when the time came âat some quick tempered individual lost
patience and tried to knock a little decent conversation out of him
with an ax.

Horace, though, thought only oâ The, and he hurried in and sat beside
him. I also went in and took my seat by the fire again. Horace took
Theâs hand in one of his and patted it with the other. Horace didnât
have any upliftinâ words to match the Friarâs; but he had some chirky
little ways which were mighty comfortinâ to The, and when Horace would
be with him, all the sadness would leave his eyes, and he would talk
as free as he thoughtâwhich, to my mind, is the final test of
genuwine courage.

Mighty few of us can do it. I know I canât. Time and again, I have had
deep feelinâs for some one in trouble; but when Iâd try to put âem
into words, the knees oâ my tongue would allus knock together, and Iâd
growl out somethinâ gruff, cough, blow my nose, and get into a corner
as soon as possible. The Friar was the first man who ever showed me
âat a feller could speak out his softness without losinâ any of his
strength, and I have honestly tried to do it myself; but I generally
had to dilute it down over half, and even then, it allus sounded as
though I had wrote it out and learned it by heart.

The asked Horace to either move him or Ty, said he didnât feel quite
comfortable beside Ty, and made out that it was his own wish; but
Horace vetoed the motion, and pertended to scold The for not havinâ a
more forgivinâ nature. The thought he had been as circumspect as a
land agent, and when his request rebounded back on him, he found
himself without any dry powder.

He lay quiet for some time, and then spoke in so low a tone I could
hardly hear him. âI can understand the real Promotheus purty well,
Horace,â sez he; âand Iâve tried to be as game as he was; but I canât
quite understand the One the Friar tells about. I have thought of Him
a heap since Iâve been laid up this time; but I donât believe I could
bring myself to forgive them who had nailed me on a cross for doinâ
nothinâ but goodâI donât believe I could do that.

âI can feel things clearer now ân I ever could before; and when I
picture my own self as hanginâ from nails drove through my hands and
feet, it just about takes my breath away. Iâve been handled purty
rough in my time, but allus when my blood was hot, and pain donât
count then; but to have nails droveâMy God, Horace, thatâs an awful
thought! Thatâs an awful thought.

âThen, too, I donât feel that any one has ill used me lately. The
treatment I got in the army, and in the pen, was considâable hellish;
but I havenât had much chance to try forgivinâ any one for the last
few years. Horace, you canât imagine all the joy the last part of my
life has been to me. I didnât know what life really was, until you and
the Friar pointed it out to me. Iâve been so happy sometimes it has
hurt me in the throat; and now that Iâm goinâ on, I donât want to
cause any one any bother. I asked Ty to tell me if he was married to
the woman, and he did tell me. Iâm sorry to say âat he is married to
her, Horace; but Iâm thankful to Ty for tellinâ me. He donât feel easy
near me; so I wish youâd move me back to the bunk-shack.â

It was some minutes before Horace could speak, and when he did, he had
to put on pressure to keep his voice steady. âI donât care one single
damn what Ty Jones wants,â sez he. âLet him stay right where he is and
learn the meaninâ of friendship from the best friend a man ever had.â
After which Horace gave Theâs hand a grip and hurried out of the room.




CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE

THE LITTLE GUST Oâ WIND


I have seen some mighty quick changes brought about by flood oâ
circumstances breakinâ on a man all of a suddenâolâ Cast Steel
Judson, himself, had melted and run into a new mold the night oâ
Barbieâs weddinââbut I never saw such a complete change as had took
place in The since Iâd first seen him. He loved devilment then, like a
bear loves honey; while now he had swung back with the pendulem clear
to the other side, until he was more unworldly ân the Friar himself.
It wasnât what he said âat made a feller feel funny inside, it was his
eyes. His eyes were all the time tryinâ to tell things âat his tongue
couldnât frame up, and it acted like brakes on a fellerâs breathinâ
apparatus.

I asked the Friar about it one eveninâ while we were walkinâ back
through the ravine. He walked along with his brows wrinkled a few
minutes, and then said: âYou see, Happy, the whole human race is made
up oâ millions of individuals, and each one is some alike and some
different. A man goes through childhood, youth, his fightinâ period,
and old age; and the race has to do the same thing.

âNow, ages ago when the childhood oâ the race began, folks were
downright primitive; they used stone axes, skins for clothing, and ate
raw flesh. They were fierce, impulsive, passionate, just like children
are if you watch âem close enough; but they lived close to nature,
just like the children do, and their bodies were vigorous, and their
minds were like dry sponges, ready to absorb whatever fell upon âem.

âThe outdoor man of to-day is still primitive; he delights in his
dissipations, and recklessness, but the grim, set face which he wears,
is a mask. The rich, pure air is all the time washinâ his body clean,
his active life keeps his nerves sound and accurate, and his heart is
like the heart of a little childâhungry for good or evil, and needinâ
a guiding hand all the time.

âIn the morninâ a child is so full oâ life that words donât mean much
to him; but when the play oâ the day is over, he comes home, through
the twilight shadows, bruised anâ disappointed anâ purty well tired
out. All day long heâs waged his little wars; but now he is mighty
glad to pillow his head close to his motherâs heart; and then it is
that the seeds oâ gentleness are easiest sprouted. This is the
twilight time for Promotheus.â

We didnât have anything more to say on this walk; but we both had
plenty to think of. It allus seemed to me that in some curious way,
the Friar, himself, was better ân his own religion. His religion made
badness a fellerâs own fault; but after gettinâ to know the Friar, it
allus made ya feel more like takinâ some share in the other fellerâs
sin, than like pointinâ your finger at him and sayinâ he never was any
good, nohow.

A couple oâ days after this, the doctor told us that the sands were
runninâ mighty low in Theâs hour-glass, and it wouldnât be long to the
end; but still we couldnât believe it. He didnât look bad, nor he
didnât suffer; and we had seen him come back from the grave almost,
that time at Olafâs when Horace had claimed his life, and had saved
him in spite of himself.

Then again, the doctor had missed it on Janet, and we were all hopinâ
heâd get slipped up on again; but The himself seemed to side with the
doctor, and Olaf took one long look, anâ then shut his lips tight anâ
shook his head. The said he wanted to live, and had done all he could
to get a clinch on life; but that it was slippinâ away from him drop
by drop, and he couldnât stay with us much longer.

He seemed to want us about him, so we dropped in and sat beside him as
long as we could keep cheerful. All through the afternoon he lay with
a serious, gentle smile on his lips, but the sadness was mostly gone,
even from his eyes. I closed my own eyes as I sat beside him, and
called up the picture oâ Badger-face the day he had wanted to lynch
Olaf. Then I opened my eyes and looked at the real Promotheus, and I
understood what the Friar meant by beinâ born again.

I spoke oâ this to olâ Tank Williams, and he fired up at me as though
I had poured red pepper in the nose of a sleepinâ cripple. âYouâre a
nice one, you are!â sez he. âIâd sooner fill myself with alcohol and
die in a stupor than to call up Theâs past at such a time as this. You
ought to be ashamed oâ yourself.â

Theâ was no way to make Tank see what I meant so I sent him in to set
with The a while, and took a little walk up the ravine. Every step I
took brought some memory oâ the time The and Horace and I had first
started to find out about the woman; and it wasnât long before I was
ready to turn back.

Janet was quite strong by this time, though she still had to wear a
bandage; and after supper, the Friar took her in to see Promotheus. He
had told her all about him, and she was mighty sorry to think âat his
end was near. She didnât recall havinâ been kind to him when he was
playinâ cripple; but the Friar had told her about this, too. Horace
had told the Friar about what Ty had said, and it had cut him purty
deep; but he had braced up better ân we expected. We didnât any of us
know what effect bringinâ Janet in sight oâ Ty would have, and when
she came into the mess-hall, we watched purty close.

Ty sat propped up, with his clenched hand restinâ outside the blanket,
and an expression on his face like that of a trapped mountain-lion. He
glared up at her as she came near; but she only looked at him with
pity in her eyes, and she didnât seem to recognize him, at allâjust
looked at him as though he was a perfect stranger which she was sorry
for, and Tank, who was settinâ next me, gave me a nudge in my short
ribs, which was about as delicate as though it had come from the hind
foot of a mule. âWell?â I whispered. âWhat do ya mean by that?â

âCouldnât ya see âat she didnât know him?â sez Tank.

âThatâs nothinâ,â sez I. âHe knew her all right.â

âYes, but Great Scott,â sez he, âa man canât claim that a womanâs his
wife if she donât know him, can he?â

âPshaw,â sez I, âif youâd settle things that way, theâ wouldnât be any
married people left. Theâ ainât one woman in fifty âat knows her
husband, and theâ ainât any men at all who know their wives.â

âYouâre just dodginâ the question,â sez Tank. âI claim that if a man
marries a woman when sheâs out of her mind, he ainât got any claim on
her when she gets back into her mind again.â

âLook here, Tank,â sez I; âyouâve never had much experience with the
world, âcause every time you went where experience was to be had, you
got too intoxicated to take notice; but Iâm tellinâ you the truth when
I say that if women didnât sometimes get out oâ their right minds,
they wouldnât get married at all.â

âAw, shut up,â sez Tank.

Janet had gone over to Promotheus, and was smoothinâ his forehead. She
had a beautiful, shapely hand, and it made me feel a little wishful to
watch her. The lay perfectly still, and his sensations must âaâ been
peculiar. Ty Jones didnât even look at âem. He kept his brows scowled
down and his gaze out the south window.

Presently Janet turned and walked out to the porch. It was an
unusually warm night, and she sat there alone, while the Friar came
back to The. Horace had gone off by himself to get a grip on his
feelinâs; but he came in about nine oâclock, and went up and took
Theâs hand. âWell,â sez he, âhave you finally got over your nonsense?
I have a lot oâ plans I want to carry out, and you know I canât have
you loafinâ much longer.â

Nothinâ suited The so well as to have a little joke put at him; but he
didnât have any come-back to this. He caught at his breath a time or
two, and then said: âI canât do it, this time, Horace. I hate to
disappoint yaâIâve been countinâ on what a good time we were goinâ to
haveâup there in the hillsâbut I canât come back this timeâI,
canât, quite, make it.â

He ended with a little gurgle and sank back on the pillow. Horace
shook him a little and then flew for the doctor, who was on the porch
oâ the old cabin. They were back in half a minute, Horace pushinâ the
doctor before him; and we all held our breaths when he felt Theâs
pulse. The doctor squirted somethinâ into Theâs arm, and after a bit,
he opened his eyes with a long sigh, and when he saw Horace bendinâ
over him, he smiled.

âI mighty near slipped away that time,â sez he. âItâs not goinâ to be
hard, Horace; and I donât want you to worry. I feel as comfortable as
if I was sleepinâ on a cloud, and there isnât one, single thing to
grieve about. Iâve been like one oâ those hard little apples which
take so long to ripen. Iâve hung up on a high bough and the rains beat
on me, and the sun shone on me, and the winds shook me about, and the
birds pecked at me until at last just the right sort oâ weather came
along and I became softer and softer, and riper and riper, until now
my hold on the stem begins to weaken. Purty soon a little gustâll come
along and shake me down on the green grass; but this is all right,
this is perfectly natural, and I donât want you to feel bad about it.

âI own up now, that Iâve been afraid oâ death all my life; but this
has passed. I donât suffer a bit; but Iâm tired, just that pleasant
weariness a feller feels when his last pipe has been smoked, and the
glow oâ the camp fire begins to form those queer pictures, in which
the doinâs oâ that day mingle with the doinâs of other days. Iâm
liable to drop off to sleep at any moment, now; and Iâd likeâIâd kind
oâ like to shake hands with the boys before I go.â

Well, this gave Horace something to do, and he was mighty glad to do
it. After we had all shaken hands with The, he marched up the
prisoners, even to the Chink, and they all shook hands, too; and by
this time Prometheus was purty tired; but he did look unusual
contented. He glanced across at Ty; but Ty had turned his face to the
wall, and The gave a little sigh, settled down into the pillow again,
and closed his eyes. Horace backed around until The couldnât see him,
and shook his fist at Ty, good and earnest.

Purty soon a regular grin came to Theâs face, and he opened his eyes
and looked at the Friar with a twinkle in âem. âFriar Tuck,â sez he,
âI donât know as I ever mentioned it before, but Iâll confess now that
Iâm right glad I didnât lynch you for stealinâ those hosses.â He lay
there smilinâ a minute, and then held out his hand. âGood-bye,
Horace,â he said in a firm voice.

Horace had been doinâ uncommon well up to now; but he couldnât stand
this. He threw himself on the bed, took both oâ Theâs hands and looked
down into his face. âPromotheus, Prometheus,â he called to him in a
shakinâ voice. âDonât give up! You can win if you fight a while
longer. Remember that day in the desert, when I wanted to lie down and
end it all. You said you didnât take any stock in such nonsense; and
you picked me up and carried me over the molten copper, while queer
things came out oâ the air and clutched at us. You reached the
water-hole that time, Promotheus, and you can do it again, if you just
use all your might.â

Promotheus opened his eyes and his jagged, gnarly teeth showed in a
smile, weak and trembly, but still game to the last line of it.
âNope,â he said so low we could hardly hear him, âIâm Promotheus, all
right. I hung on as long as I could; but the vultures have finished my
liver at last, Horaceâthey have finally finished it. I hate to leave
you; but Iâll have to be goinâ soon. Theâs only one thing I ask of
yaâdonât send a single one oâ the boys to the pen. They donât know
what the world really is; but shuttinâ âem out of it wonât ever teach
âem. If theâs anything you can do to give âem a little start, it would
be a mighty good thingâa mighty good thing.â His voice was gettinâ
awful weak, anâ heâd have to rest every few words.

âAnd Ty Jones, too,â he went on, âTy was square with me in the old
days. Try to make him understand what it was âat turned me againâ him;
and if theâs any way to make things easier for Ty, I want you to have
it done. Ty had a lot oâ tough times, himself, before he turned all
the hard part of his nature outside. Donât bear him any malice,
Horace. Seventy times seven, the Friar sez we ought to forgive, and
that manyâll last a long time, if a feller donât take offence too
easy. Theâs a lot oâ things I donât understand; but some way it seems
to me that if I could just go out feelinâ I had squared things with
Ty, Iâd be a leetle mite easier in my mind.â

Horace stepped to Tyâs bed and shook him by the arm. âDid you hear
what he said?â he demanded. âYou know heâs achinâ to have you speak to
him decent. Why donât ya speak to him?â

Ty looked cold and stony into Horaceâs eyes, and then took his left
hand and pushed Horaceâs grip from off his arm. Horace stood lookinâ
at Ty with his fist clinched. The turned and saw it and a troubled
look came into his face.

âFriar Tuck,â he said, âyou meant it, didnât yaâthat about forgivinâ
seventy times seven?â

âI did,â sez the Friar, his voice ringinâ out clear and strong in
spite of its beinâ low pitched. âBe at peace, Promotheus, the laws of
man are at war with the laws of God; but theyâre bound to lose in the
end. I want you to know that I forgive Ty Jones as fully as you
doâand I shall do everything in my power to square things up with
him.â

The held out his hand to the Friar, and they clasped in a
comrade-grip. âI can trust you,â he said; âand I know youâll do all
you can to make Horace see it that way, too.â

âI forgive him, too, you big goose!â cried Horace. âI promise you that
Iâll do all I can for himâon your account. Though I must sayâbut no,
I mean it, Promotheus. I forgive him from my heart, and Iâll be as
good a friend to him as I can.â

âNow, let the little gust oâ wind come,â sez The. âIâm perfectly ripe
and ready for it, now.â

Theâ was silence for several minutes; and then Promotheus said in a
faint voice: âFriar, I wish youâd sing to me. All my life Iâve longed
to hear a cradle-song, a regular baby cradle-song. I know itâs a
damn-fool notion; but I never had it so strong as Iâve got it nowâand
I wish youâd sing one to me. My mother was a widow, mostly. She
cleaned out offices at night to earn enough to keep us alive. She
sacrificed her life for me, but I couldnât understand this then.

âNight after night I used to creep in from the street through dirty,
stinkinâ halls, and cry myself to sleep. An achinâ came into my heart
then which hasnât never quite left it; and it was this lonesomeness
âat finally made me run awayâleavinâ her to face it outâall by
herself.

âMy blood has turned to water, I reckon, and I feel like a baby
to-night. I donât suffer, understand; I feel as though I was a little
chap again, and that my mother didnât have to work; but was holdinâ me
on her lap. She did hold me that way onceâthe time the ambulance
brought my old man homeâbut she couldnât sing then. It seems to me
that if youâd just sing me a regular cradle-songâI could slip away
into pleasant dreams.â

The Friar cleared his throat a time or two before he found his voice;
and then he said in a low tone: âI used to sleep in a store-box,
Promotheus, when I was a ladâand I know exactly what you feel. Iâll
sing you a cradle-song, a song for little children of all ages. It is
a great privilege to be a little child, Promotheus, andâand I wish
you pleasant dreams.â

Then Friar Tuck drew a deep, full breath, and held it down until all
the quiver had gone from his lips. When he started to sing, his voice
was low anâ soothinâ, and full oâ tenderness; and after the first
line, Promotheus gave a little sigh oâ content, nodded his head, and
shut his eyes.

Theâ was one tune we every last one of us liked. The Friar generally
sang it to words which began: âGuide me, O Thou great Jehovahâ; and he
usually sang it with a swing which was like a call to battle; and this
time he sang the same tune, but soft and close and restful, and the
words he used began: âJesus, tender Shepherd, hear me.â These words
sound purty flat when ya give âem cold; but they didnât sound empty to
us, as we stood lookinâ down at Promotheus. All alone, he had taken
his chance when he took on with Ty Jones; and now he was cashinâ in
this chance and it made us mighty sober.

The Friar finished the first four lines alone, and then the angels
seemed to join in with him. We had all been purty certain that theâ
wasnât nothinâ in the shape of earthly melody fit to hold a candle to
the Friar; but just at this point a new voice joined onto the Friarâs
which sent a thrill through us and made us stop breathinâ. A queer,
half frightened look crossed the Friarâs face for a second; but his
voice didnât waver for a single note. Instead, theâ came a new tone of
thanksgivinâ and confidence in it which took all the sting out oâ
death and made it all right and pleasant, like the cool and
restfulness oâ night, after the heat of day.

    âAll this day Thy hand has led me,
    And I thank Thee for Thy care;
    Thou hast warmed me, clothed and fed me;
    Listen to my evening prayer,â

went on the song and theâ came an expression of wonder and of joy into
Theâs tired face.

There are only three little verses to this one, and to fill out the
tune they had to sing the first one over again, soft and low. The
candles threw a soft glow on Theâs face which hid the pallor of it and
the rough lines, but brought out all the kindly strength we had come
to be so fond of; and when the music died away, we all sat still for
fear oâ disturbinâ him.

Horace had been settinâ holdinâ one of his hands, and after a bit he
leaned forward and whispered, âWas that what you wanted, Promotheus?â

But theâ wasnât any reply. The little gust oâ wind had come with the
songâand fully ripe, and soft to the core of his big, warm heart,
Promotheus had loosed his hold on the bough of life, and dropped off
onto the soft, deep grass of eternity.

âPromotheus! Promotheus!â cried Horace, and then covered his face with
his hands and dropped forward upon Theâs quiet breast.

âBadger-face,â called a harsh voice, and we looked at Ty Jones and saw
him leaninâ towards The. âWait, Badger-face, waitâI want to speak to
ya. I want to tell you that I lied to ya. Oh Lord, itâs too late, itâs
too late!â And Ty Jones pressed his hand across his eyes and sank
back.

Horace whirled to tell Ty what he thought of him; but the Friar placed
his big hand on Horaceâs shoulder, and pointed down to Theâs placid
face. Horace gave a shudderinâ sob, and settled back into his former
position.

Janet Morris crossed the floor to the Friar just then and said to him
in a low tone: âI have found it againâmy voice has come back to me.â

Ty Jones took his hand down from his eyes and straightened up and
looked at her. All the eagle had gone from his face, and it looked old
and haggard. âDonât you really know who I am?â he asked.

She looked at him and shook her head.

âIâm your half-brother,â he said. âIâm Tyrell Jones Morris. Your
mother might have been a good woman, but she was not good to meâshe
wasnât fair; she prejudiced my father againâ me. You were sellinâ
tickets at an elevated station in New York when I found you. You
looked a good deal like your mother, for you were weak and sickly. I
didnât know then, whether I brought you back with me because we had
the same blood in our veins, or because I hated youâand I donât know
yet. Iâm not tellinâ you this now, because I care any thing for you,
or the preacher; but Badger-face was square, and I know now âat heâd
never have turned againâ me if the rest of ya hadnât tampered with
him. Iâm sorry I didnât tell him before he diedâand thatâs why Iâm
tellinâ you now.â

I winked my eyes to the boys, and we filed out and went over to the
bunk-shack. We lighted our pipes and sat a long time smokinâ in
silence. One by one they dropped off to bed until only me and olâ Tank
Williams was left. Tank sat with a sour look on his face, and so
deeply buried in thought that the burnt matches around his stool
looked like a wood pile. âWhat are ya thinkinâ of, Tank?â I said to
him.

âIâm not kickinâ, understand,â sez he; âbut it does seem to me that
when all The asked for was a cradle-song, the Friar could âaâ thought
up somethinâ besides another one oâ those doggone sheep-herder hymns.
The didnât have any more use for sheep-herders ân I have.â

This was the real Tank, all right. Once an idee took possession of
him, it rode him rough shod till he keeled over with his tongue
hanginâ out.




CHAPTER FORTY-SIX

THE FINAL MOVES


We buried The by the side oâ Tim Simpson. Horace insisted on makinâ a
coffin for himâfact was, he wanted to have a regular funeral, but we
talked him out oâ this; so he made a coffin himself and lined it with
silk which Ty Jones had brought out for Janet to make dresses of. The
Friar held some short services, but he didnât sing or preach any. Some
way, theâ didnât seem to be any need of it. After we had covered him
over we stood around talkinâ for quite a while; and then only turned
away because the first rain we had had for months came rattlinâ down
from the mountains.

âDo you see that, now?â asked olâ Tank after we had reached the porch
and were sittinâ watchinâ it come down in torrents.

âIâm not totally blind,â sez I.

âWell, Iâm not superstitious,â sez Tank; âbut Iâm bettinâ that heâs
had that tended to, himself. He wasnât one to forget his friends, and
he knew âat what we needed most was rainâso heâs called attention to
it the first chance heâs had.â

Fact was, Tank was so everlastinâ superstitious that he spelt Tomas
with an âhâ in it to keep from havinâ thirteen letters in his full
name; but it did seem queer about this rain, because they wasnât any
sane man in the world who would have expected a rain just at this
time. Itâs astonishinâ how many curious things there is if a feller
just takes notice of âem.

The Friar and Ty had had a long talk the night âat Promotheus slipped
away, and the Friar had agreed to settle down at the ranch and do what
he could for Ty. Ty wasnât thankful; but he hadnât much choice, so he
behaved better ân any one would have expected. The Friar wanted me to
stay and be foreman for him; but I told him I had promised Jabez to
come back as soon as I had got a good holt on myself again; and I
intended to leave for the Diamond Dot the minute things were right at
the Cross brand. The Friar didnât much trust Pepper Kendal for
foreman; but the minute I thought it over, I saw that Olaf was the
very man, and this suited the Friar to a T.

We brought the prisoners up to Ty and he told âem how things were and
advised âem to adjust themselves to new conditions as fast as
possible, and they all agreed to do it and went to work under Olaf.
The Friar knew a preacher at Laramie; so Horace gave Tillte Dutch the
job oâ goinâ after him, and as soon as he came, the Friar and Janet
were married, and then I made plans to hit the trail for the Diamond
Dot.

Horace had made up his mind to build himself a cabin up at our old
camp and he tried to hire me for life; but I had taken root at the
Diamond, and when I explained things to him, he owned up I was right.
I suggested to Horace that olâ Tank Williams was the very man for him,
and he admitted, when he came to look it over, that Tank would suit
him a heap better for hired help ân I would. He even went so far as to
say he never could understand how it came âat a stiff-necked man like
olâ Jabez could put up with my independent ways. I told Horace theâ
was a lot of things it wasnât necessary for him to understand, and
then I whistled to Tank, and he came over and joined us.

Tank rolled the notion about in his head a while, and then he sez:
âHorace, Iâll take ya up. We both got cured up of our nerves on the
same trip, and ever since then I have to own that youâve found favor
in my sight; but the one thing âat counts bigger ân anything else, is
the fact that, come what will, youâll never have any more hankerinâ to
be pestered by a lot oâ sheep, than I will.â

Olaf started to get things ready for the round-up and us Diamond Dot
boys, aside from olâ Tank, rode off home, where we found things in
considâable of a muddle. Durinâ the three years previous I had been
takinâ more and more oâ the responsibility onto my own shoulders, and
olâ Cast Steel found himself purty rusty. We turned to and
straightened things out, and then I settled down to the sober business
oâ handlinâ a big outfit with a view on the future.

After this, I didnât do any more skitinâ around than my peculiar
nature seemed to insist on; but I did make out to pay the Cross brand
a visit every once in a while. The Friar only intended to stay long
enough to get things to slidinâ easy; and then he and Janet were to go
back East and work among the city poor; but the chance never came.

Janet grew perfectly strong and well again; but the city allus made
her nervous to return to the mountains, and they were kept so busy on
the ranch that the years slipped away without beinâ noticed.

Tyâs backbone was all in one piece, and solidâexcept where Olaf had
unjointed itâand it took years to wear him down to friendliness; but
when the Friarâs first baby got big enough to creep, the contrary
little cuss took more interest in olâ Ty Jones, than in airy other
thing theâ was on the place. I never saw any one yet who didnât feel
flattered at a babyâs endorsementâthough why a baby should be
supposed to actually have better judgment than grown folks has never
been fully explained to me yet.

Horace kept his word to The, and he did all he could for Ty. Ty didnât
like him and he didnât like Ty; but Ty was human, and it made him
lonely to sit in one spot all the time, so that while he refused to be
thankful, he gradually got to relyinâ on Horace; and Horace was also
human, and the more he did for Ty on Theâs account, the more fond he
grew of Ty on his own account. He got him a wheelchair first, and this
was a big help. Then he fixed up a trapeze for Ty to practice on. Ty
got mad about this and said that cripple though he was, no man could
make a monkey of him; but one night when he couldnât sleep he
practiced on it, and it gave him a lot oâ relief.

The name of the Chinaman was Yuen Yick, and he thought âat Ty Jones
was some sort of a god, and fair worshipped himâevery one oâ Tyâs men
swore by him, even after he turned decent. Ty used to abuse the Chink
all he could and it pleased âem both; and the Chink saw that Horace
meant well by Ty, so he kept Horace posted on just what Ty did and
thought; and Horace had Janet make some flannel bricks filled with
cotton for Ty to throw at the Chinaman. Ty got a lot oâ satisfaction
out oâ these bricks, and the exercise helped him too.

Next, Horace had a wide porch built all around Tyâs house, and he
swung ropes with rings on âem from the ceiling, an equal distance
apart; and Ty got so he could swing from ring to ring, and go all
around the house, and climb ladders, and as the boy got big enough to
become tyrannical, which was soon enough, goodness knows, he made Ty
do all manner oâ stuntsâthrow balls and juggle âem, tell stories,
draw picturesâWell, the fact was, that between âem all, they kept Ty
so active that first we knew, the devil had all been worked out of him
and he was as civilized as any of us. One day when Horace was down
visitinâ him, he sent in the Chink and had him bring out a set of
ivory figures, carved most beautiful and called chess-men; and he
dared Horace to play him a game, and this was the final surrender of
the old Ty Jones.

He was a well edicated man, Ty was; and each winter when he had left
the ranch, he had gone to some big city where he had pertended to be a
regular swell. No one ever found out just what had soured him so on
the world, for his nature was to be sociable to a degree. He said that
no one knew the cause of it except olâ Promotheus, and it was mightily
to his credit that he hadnât devulged the secret.

Ty strung out his surprises quite a while. It seems he was also an
inventor, and had patents which brought him in a lot oâ money. He had
found this cave and had just widened it where wideninâ was necessary,
and had built his cabin above it. The floor was double and filled with
earth, and the fake drawers were also filled with earth, so âat no
sound would show that it was hollow underneath. The drawers swung on a
steel piller which could be worked from above by a rope which hung
back oâ his bookcase and from below by a lever.

It was a curious thing to see Ty Jones with his bristly eyebrows and
his eagleâs beak of a nose, makinâ mechanical toys for the Friarâs and
Olafâs children. They didnât put any limit on what he was able to do,
and he used to grumble at âem as fierce as a grizzlyâand then
back-track like an Injun, and do whatever they wanted him to.

The Friar never quite gave up his plot to go back and work among the
poor; but theâ was allus so many things imposed upon him by the home
folks that he was pestered with letters every time he left; and
usually compromised by gatherinâ up a bunch oâ the poor as hasty as
possible, and bringinâ âem back with him. His head was full of what he
called welfare plans, and he settled the poor along all the likely
cricks he found vacant, and bulldozed âem into goinâ to work. Itâs a
curious coincident; but most of âem turned out well.

Theâ was a bilious feller out visitinâ me once, which called himself a
sosologist. I told him about some oâ the Friarâs projects; and he said
that the Friar was nothinâ but a rank Utopian, and that this sort oâ
work would never remove all the evils of the world.

âYou can call him anything ya want to,â sez I, âso long as itâs a word
I donât understand; but the Friarâs not tryinâ to remove all the evils
in the world. He only removes those evils he can find by spendinâ his
whole life in huntinâ for âem; but he certainly does remove these ones
in quick and able shape.â

Another time, right after the Friar had brought about a settlement
between some sheep and cattle men, a preacher dropped off to give his
appetite a little exercise at the Diamond Dot. He belonged to the same
herd that the Friar had cut out from, and I thought he would be
interested; so I told him considâable about the Friar. He was a most
judicious-lookinâ man, but baggy under the eyes and chin. He got all
fussed up when I spoke well oâ the Friar, and said he was
un-co-nonical, said he was unorthodoxâOh, he cut loose and swore at
the Friar in his own tongue âtil I about lost my temper.

âLook here,â I sez to him, âit would take me some months to tell you
all the good deeds the Friar has actually done; but Iâll just give you
one single example. If I was to live up to my natural disposition, Iâd
wring your neck, or shoot off your ears, or somethinâ like that; but
owinâ to the Friar havinâ taught me self-control, Iâm not even goinâ
to snap my fingers againâ your blue nose. Make yourself perfectly at
home here, and stay as long as the East can spare ya; but youâll have
to excuse me for a while, as the Friar has just written me an order to
go over into the Basin to see what can be done for a young feller who
has been arrested for hoss-stealinâ.â

Horace contributes liberally to the Friarâs projects; but he donât
take a hand in the game, himselfâexcept with the imported poor which
are gathered at the Cross brand, waitinâ to be transplanted. Every
year he seems to shrink about an eighth of an inch smaller, and get
about that much tougher. He lights out for a trip now and again, and
olâ Tank allus tags along, grumblinâ. Tank thinks full as much of
Horace as The did; but Tankâs a different proposition. The easier his
lot is the more he grumbles; but I like nothinâ better than to have a
chat with him over old times.

One night I was up visitinâ Horace, and after supper we got a little
restless and started out for a walk. We sauntered down to our old
look-out and stood gazinâ down at the lights of the Cross brand ranch.
Ty had rigged up a water power to manufacture e-lectricity, simply
because the children had needed it to run some oâ their idees, but
theâ was plenty of it to light the whole place. In token of Tyâs
brand, and also as a symbol of his own callinâ, the Friar had built an
immense cross on the cliff just above the mouth of the ravine, and on
the upright, and at each end oâ the cross-piece were big electric
lights. These could be seen for miles, and every one knew âat whatever
troubles they had, there was allus welcome, cheery hospitality, and
sound advice waitinâ for âem in the shadow of this cross.

It was a moonlight night, one of those crisp, bright nights, when it
makes a feller feel solemn just to get up high and look down at the
beauty of the old, hard Earth. We had been talkinâ oâ the old days as
usual; but not talkinâ much, for we each saw the same set of pictures
when we looked down from here, and they didnât need many words.

âLife is like a game oâ chess,â sez Horace. âThe openinâ is not so
absolutely vital; but after a time theâ comes one little move which is
the keynote of all the balance of the gameâand the same is true oâ
life. The way things has turned out down yonder seems to be the very
best way they could have turned out; but itâs hard to look back and
tell just what was the keynote of it all. Of course
PromotheusâPromotheus was the prime mover; but then all the way along
you can see the Friarâs influence. What would you say was the keynote
oâ this tangled game, Happy?â

I looked down at Horace: he was wearinâ a battered old hat, rough
clothes and leggins, and smokinâ a corncob pipe. âThatâs an easy one,â
sez I, tryinâ to shake off a feelinâ oâ sadness which was beginninâ to
creep over me, in spite of all I could do; âgettinâ your nerves cured
up, Horace, was the keynote of it all.â

âThat was a long time ago,â sez Horace, âa long, long time ago.â

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
