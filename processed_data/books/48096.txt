INTRODUCTION


[Illustration]

It would be difficult to think of _Mr. Punchâs_ prototype of the
immortal drama as âin Societyâ; but, however much our national jester
may resemble in facial detail the somewhat rude and impulsive character
from whom he took his name, he is in all his instincts a gentleman. In
other words, it is just here that PUNCH has differed from most comic
journals, being, if not absolutely from the first number, certainly
from its early days, distinguished for refinement of taste and good
manners, not less than for its wit and humour. âMR. PUNCH in Societyâ
is indeed MR. PUNCH in his most congenial surroundings, as he has been
above all else the untiring, irrepressible satirist of the social world.

If an analysis were made of all the drawings which have appeared in
PUNCH from 1841 to the present day, we venture to think that those
devoted to Societyâs ways, its foibles, its follies, would greatly
outnumber the illustrations of any other phase of life. And was not
the entire career of one of MR. PUNCHâS most celebrated artists
devoted exclusively to social satire? The name of George du Maurier
is pre-eminent in the history of modern humorous art. To an unerring
instinct for character, shrewd but never unkindly satire, he united a
profound sense of beauty which made his work unique and individual. It
was thus that to a vast public, of which only a very small proportion
could be expected to possess any art culture, Du Maurierâs work
appealed with irresistible force, his charming lightness of touch,
his gaiety, which came no doubt from his Gallic origins, rendering
everything from his pencil a source of delight to the general public,
no less than to the students of draughtsmanship.

Du Maurierâs connection with PUNCH began in 1860 and his earliest work
displayed very little of that wonderful grace to which it attained
before many years had passed, but Mr. Henry James, discussing his
art so long ago as 1883, said that âsince 1868, PUNCH has been,
artistically speaking, George du Maurier,â an opinion which would
certainly be accepted in America, where for a generation the cultured
classes looked to Du Maurier, as Mr. Spielman reminds us, âalmost
exclusively, not only for English fashions in male and female attire,
the _derniÃ¨re mode_ in social etiquette, but for the truest reflection
of English life and character.â

When we consider that almost exclusively in the pages of MR. PUNCH
is the artistic life-work of Du Maurier contained, we shall see
how inexhaustible a treasury is there to be drawn upon for such a
collection as the present. We have thought it wise, however, not to
limit âMR. PUNCH in Societyâ to the work of any one humorist, but have
sought to present a collection of Du Maurierâs best social satires in
company with those of many other artists who, in their individual ways,
have also depicted the humours of social life.

A SEASONABLE LETTER

[Illustration]

                                                  _Huntingthorpe Hall._

MY DEAR JACK,--I want you to come down on Monday and stay a couple of
days with me. My wife will be delighted, as you can help her with a
childrenâs party, and also play Pantaloon in a little thing being got
up by the young people. I will mount you on the Tuesday with our Stag
hounds, as I know you are fond of a dayâs hunting. No, donât thank me,
my dear chap--I shall be only too glad if you will go, as the horse I
am intending to put you on is a rank brute, and when he doesnât refuse
his fences--which is a rare occurrence--he invariably falls into them.
However, you wonât mind _that_, will you?

You will have to put up with real bachelor accommodation, I am afraid,
as the house is crammed. The best I can do for you is a half share of
one of the attics. Our cook has left us, all unexpectedly, so this
places her room at our disposal for two of you. The kitchen-maid is
doing her best to keep us from starving; but, though she means well, I
can hardly class her as a _cordon bleu_.

Louise Dearlove, that pretty little girl you were so sweet upon last
season, is unable to come; but her brother--the red-headed youth who
was always trying to pick a quarrel with you--will be here.

I am so short of horses that I fear I must ask you to cab the four
miles up from the station; but I am sure you wonât mind taking the
rough with the smooth.

                                              Yours ever,
                                                          JOHN JOSTLER.

As the recipient of the above invitation, I ask which is âthe smoothâ?

THE âBOOK TEAâ

    Scene--_The Drawing-rooms of No. 1 and No. 2, Upperten
    Mansions, S.W._

_First Lady (entering)._ Here I am! I am sure you wonât guess who I am.
See, the American Banner and the Union Jack. I represent âUnder Two
Flags.â

_First Hostess._ Oh, how clever! But we shall have Mr. Smith here
presently, and he is sure to come in something quite new.

_Second Lady (entering)._ Here I am. Now you will never know what book
I represent. Stars and stripes on one shoulder, the white ensign on the
other! âUnder Two Flags.â Eh?

_First Hostess._ Wonderful! We shall have Mr. Smith here by and by. He
is sure to amuse us.

_Third Lady (entering)._ I promised to come and here I am. The Star
Spangled Banner and our own Royal Standard. âUnder Two Flags.â There,
isnât it good?

_First Hostess._ Quite too good! So pleased you have come. We are
waiting for Mr. Smith. Heâs sure to make us all laugh, as heâs _so_
original!

_Fourth Lady._ Up to my time! And I have come as a well-known book.
See, a dear little American banner on one side of my head, and a weeny,
weeny Union Jack on the other. âUnder Two Flags.â I thought I would
surprise you!

_First Hostess._ I knew you would. Mr. Smith is coming! Heâs sure to be
funny.

_Mr. Smith (entering)._ Now you must guess. I wonât take off my cloak
until I have shown you these two dolls. Here they are, soldiers of the
time of Louis XIV. And now you shall see me. (_Throws off his cloak
and appears in gorgeous costume._) I represent, with the help of my
companions, âThe Three Musketeers.â

_Second Hostess (rigidly)._ I think there is some mistake. This is a
meeting of the Distressed Charwomenâs Food Fund Association. I think
you must have wanted to attend my neighbour next doorâs Book Tea.

_Mr. Smith (hastily resuming his cloak)._ Oh, I beg your pardon.

THE SOCIETY VOICE

[A contemporary complains that most people in Society consider it
necessary to address one another in shrill, high-pitched voices.]

    Youâre pretty, Miss Kitty, and dainty and slim,
      And graceful indeed is your mien;
    Your eyes are as bright and your ankle as trim
      As any the writer has seen.
    Your curly brown locks, which invite a caress,
      Would make any artist rejoice;
    But youâve one little fault, even I must confess,
      And thatâs your Society voice.

    When I asked you to wed me a fortnight ago
      At Mrs. De Jenkynsonâs ball,
    I never expected you, Kit, to say âNoâ
      In tones that would ring through the hall.
    You dreamt not--how should you, of course?--that the sound
      Of your voice would be heard far and wide,
    But I _did_ feel a fool when a titter went round
      As we walked to your chaperonâs side.

    A beautiful maiden was never yet won,
      âTis said, by a faint-hearted swain;
    And so, Mistress Kit, ere the season is done
      I am sure to approach you again.
    And oh! if your feelings should leave you no choice
      But to utter the verdict I dread,
    Pronounce not my doom at the top of your voice,
      But speak in a whisper instead.

THE LATEST THING IN CRIME

    SCENE--_Mrs. Featherstonâs Drawing-room. Mrs. Thistledown

_Mrs. Thistledown_ (_taking up a novel on a side-table_). âThe Romance
of a Plumber,â by Paul Poshley. My dear Flossie, you _donât_ mean to
tell me you read _that_ man?

_Mrs. Featherston._ I havenât had time to do more than dip into it as
yet. But why, Ida? _Oughtnât_ I to read him?

_Ida._ Well, from something Mr. Pinceney told me the other day--but
really itâs too bad to repeat such things. One never knows, there _may_
be nothing in it.

_Flossie._ Still, you might just as well _tell_ me, Ida! Of course I
should never dream----

_Ida._ After all, I donât suppose thereâs any secret about it. It
seems, from what Mr. Pinceney says, that this Mr. Poshley--you must
_promise_ not to say I told you----

_Flossie._ Of course--of course. But do go on, Ida. What _does_ Mr.
Poshley do?

_Ida._ Well, it appears he _splits his infinitives_.

_Flossie_ (_horrified_). Oh, not _really_! But how _cruel_ of him! Why,
I met him at the Dragnettsâ only last week, and he didnât look at _all_
that kind of person!

_Ida._ Iâm afraid thereâs no doubt about it. Itâs perfectly notorious.
And of course any one who once takes to _that_----

_Flossie._ Yes, indeed. _Quite_ hopeless. At least, I _suppose_ so.
Isnât it?

_Ida._ Mr. Pinceney seemed to think so.

_Flossie._ How sad! But canât anything be _done_, Ida? Isnât there
any law to punish him? By the bye, how _do_ you split--what is
it?--infinitudes?

_Ida._ My dear, I thought you knew. I really didnât like to ask any
questions.

_Flossie._ Well, whatever it is, I shall tell Mudies not to send me
anything more of his. I _donât_ think one ought to encourage such
persons.

SERVICE AND SOCIETY NEWS

(_According to Mr. Sheldon_)

    [âThe Rev. Charles M. Sheldon has just aroused the wrath of the
    ladies of Topeka by his views on the servant-girl problem. He
    advocated from the pulpit âthe hired girlâ should be treated
    as one of the family and cherished, not chided.â--_Pall Mall
    Gazette._]

Lord Doubleshire entertained a small party of friends at his town house
last evening. After dinner the servants mingled freely with the guests,
and the Marchioness of Stoke Newington was presented to the second
stair-maid, Miss Elizabeth Wilkins, whose acquaintance she made.

Among the smart âbridgeâ parties last week must be numbered Mrs. Algey
Bouncebyâs. Her butler, Thomas Scraggs, who paired for the first rubber
with the Duke of Dunkirk, is fast proving his claim to be one of the
finest exponents of this fashionable card game.

We understand that the Countess of Crumbleton has issued cards to a
distinguished but select few to meet her coachman, Mr. John Jenkins.

At the theatre the other evening, conspicuous among a remarkably
well-dressed set of people, we noticed Lord Loughboro, the Hon. Misses
Loughboro, and the head gardener, Ezekiel Jilks. The latter gentleman
wore the famous silver Albert watch-chain, a Christmas present, it is
understood, from Miss Gwendolen Loughboro, the bestowal of which gift
has aroused so much comment in aristocratic and horticultural circles.

Half-a-dozen dissatisfied members of Brooksâs club are talking of
resigning if Lord Livewellâs groom is not black-balled. He was of
course put up by Lord Livewell himself and seconded by his uncle, Earl
Gothepace. One or two rumours have certainly reached us reflecting
on the temperance of Bob Whippet, the handsome groom. But for the
old-fashioned prejudices which evidently animate the action of the
discontented six, we have nothing but the severest reproof.

Owing to the severe illness of Miss Madeline Marrowby, the stall at
the forthcoming Bazaar will be taken by her maid Ellen Cripps. As
previously arranged, the stall-holders will be presented individually
to the Royal Visitors.

In the forthcoming golf competition, at Hoylake, Miss Susan Bates, the
scullery-maid to Hon. Miss Fitzwinter, is looked on as a likely prize
winner. Her handicap playing has shown a wonderful improvement lately,
so much so that her considerate mistress has given her permission to
forego her ordinary duties of washing up the dishes and filling the
coal scuttles, in order that she may get in a good morningâs practice
on the links.

Among the presentations for the next Drawing-room we are glad to notice
the name of Kate Briggs, the pretty second parlour-maid of Lord and
Lady Wigmore. It will be remembered that their head butler attended the
last levÃ©e. A full description of Miss Briggsâs presentation costume
appears elsewhere.

THE LAMENT OF THE LADIESâ MAN

    In youth I never cared for sport;
      Fresh air was not a passion to me;
    Athletic feats of any sort
      Sent unresponsive shudders through me;
    I had, in fact, a sedentary mind,
    And hated exercise of any kind.

    And so, when others smote the sphere
      With bat or mallet, boots or putter,
    I charmed (with song) the female ear,
      And made the female bosom flutter.
    I also played the zither and recited
    Poems of young loves, prematurely blighted.

    I sang, as I have said: I had
      That kind of voice that folks call âflutyâ;
    I trilled of âMemories strangely sad,â
      Of âPansiesâ and the âEyes of Beauty.â
    Not more divinely does the early bird
    Sing when the worm has recently occurred.

    At that delightful hour of gloom,
      Slightly anterior to tea-time,
    I paralysed the drawing-room
      With trifles of my own in three-time,
    Till all the air was heavy with Desire,
    And prostrate matrons begged me to retire.

    Just then a vogue for High Romance
      Prevailed, and Iâd a pent-up yearning;
    The hollow cheek, the hungry glance,
      Betrayed the fever inly burning;
    At inconvenient times the thing would out,
    Especially when ladies were about.

    Somehow the care of female hearts
      At that time always fell to my lot;
    Within the maze of Cupidâs arts
      I was their guiding star, their pilot;
    Not to have loved me with a blinding passion
    Was, broadly speaking, to be out of fashion.

    But latterly, I donât know why,
      That star has waned, until at last Iâm
    Left in the lurch while maidens fly
      Towards the ruder forms of pastime;
    And now their talk is all of tennis courts,
    Of golf, gymkhanas and athletic sports.

    I donât complain. I know thereâll be
      One of these days a mild renaissance
    In the exclusive cult of ME:
      I view the fact with some complaisance;
    One day thereâll come an era of the Brain,
    And Theodore will be himself again.

monkey, which has been suffering lately from phlebitis, is well on the

maker, was a chestnut.

Mrs. Martin Bradleyâs French poodle is rapidly re-covering. It is

The alarming rumour that Lord Barndoreâs famous owl (which had been

is happily contradicted this morning. It appears that the owl had
merely left the house for a few hours for a special purpose-to wit, to
woo!

A DANCE DIALOGUE

âA smartish affair this,â I said to the little man with the pale-blue
eyes, who leant disconsolately against the wall.

He laughed nervously. I felt drawn to him, somehow. He appeared to know
no one, and I knew very few intimately, and hadnât succeeded yet in
discovering the host and hostess.

âBut I should say,â I went on, drawing inspiration from my new
acquaintanceâs sympathetic attention, âI should say it cost our host
Sir Tumnal Tintz a pretty penny. The champagne is exactly up to par,
and no stint.â

âReally, Iâm glad to hear you say so.â

âReassuring, isnât it?â

From our point of vantage we could command a full view of the
ball-room. The melody of the waltz, the perfume, and the frou-frou of
Parisian and Viennese confections had lulled the little man into a
delicious reverie.

âThere,â I said, âyou see that old chap who looks as if he had stolen
the Eastern Hemisphere and put it under his waistcoat--that explains
the fizz!â

My friend looked exceedingly puzzled.

âThatâs Gootzegog--the chap who supplied the wine. Oh, everybody knows
Sir Tumnal runs things a bit above his income. Lady Tintz has social
ambitions. Whatâs the consequence? Bills are paid by invitations to
meet all the exclusive and celebrated, instead of by coin of the realm.
Gootzegog accepted with pleasure--on the back of a receipted bill for
six dozen âbottles of the boy.ââ

âReally, this is exceedingly unpl----â

âSocial sins,â I said. âYouâll know them all by heart by and by. Itâs
only a question of time. Now, you see that woman hop-waltzing. There,
just passed us, high-pitched voice, pearls----â

âYes, yes, but----â

âThat is Mrs. Grinburger, known in Chatham Street as Juliette & Cie.,
swagger dressmakers, where Lady Tintz can make up her betting-book, and
hedge--by patronising the Grinburger.â

âUpon my word!â in astonishment.

âScandalous having to meet these people. And that thin woman bare-ly
clothed--ha! ha! excuse my little quip.â

âI know----â

âMdlle. Sembrach--bonnets; supplies the Tintz girls with headgear,
and is allowed to pass as a friend of the family because she forgets
to send in the bill. Convenient, isnât it? She looks like making a
match--or a breach of promise----â

âIt is incredible,â almost vociferated my little friend, whose eyes I
was evidently opening as to the ways and means of a certain, or rather
uncertain, class of society. âIt is incredible,â he said, âthat you
should tell me all these scandalous tales in the house where you are
privileged----â

âQuite so, quite so,â I said, fearing I may have wounded his
sensibilities. âOne only does this sort of thing when the function is a
fizzle. But you appeared to know no one.â

âYou appear to know everyone----â

âA good many. Come, let us have a stroll round and try and find the
host.â

The little man blinked nervously.

THE SOCIETY SWEAR

    make use of that deplorable expression.â--_A correspondent to
    the Daily Express._]

        The age is unmistakably profane;
        Morality, like trade, is on the wane:
        Of late with most profound regret Iâve heard

    Quite impolite, and quite unparliamentâry too,
    Once vulgar, nowâs affected by the gentry too.

        From common oaths my tender spirit shrinks,

        The cabbyâs curse my moral system shocks,
        I shudder when I hear it from the box;
    But that which on the raw more sorely touches is
    The swear thatâs used by dowagers and duchesses.

        When in the case of nobly-bred adults
        Age and experience yield these sad results,
        What wonder if their daughters (pretty lambs!)

    (A âplay âpoâ wordsâ which serves to render printable

                        CHAPTER I.--_Despare!_

It was Midnite! The bewtifool Countess of Belgravier sat at the hopen
winder of her Boodwar gazing on the full moon witch was jest a rising
up above the hopposite chimbleys. Why was that evenly face, that
princes had loved and Poets sillybrated, bathed in tears? How offen had
she, wile setting at that hopen winder, washed it with Oder Colone, to
remove the stanes of them tell tail tears? But all in wane, they wood
keep running down that bewtifool face as if enamelled with its buty;
and quite heedless of how they was a spiling of her new ivory cullered
sattin dress that Maddam Eliseâs yung ladies had been a workin on up to
five a clock that werry arternoon.

She had bin to the great ball of the Season, to be washupped as usual
by the world of Fashun, but wot had driven her home at the hunerthly
hour of harf-parst Eleven? Ah, that cruel blo, that deadly pang, that
despairin shok, must be kep for the nex chapter.

                    CHAPTER II.--_The Helopemeant!_

Seated in the Housekeeperâs own Room at the Dook of Surreyâs lovely
Manshun, playfoolly patting his fatted calves, and surrounded by his
admiring cirkle, sat Charles, the ero of my Tale. Charles was the
idle of that large establishment. They simply adored him. It was not
only his manly bewty, tho that mite have made many an Apoller envy
him. It was not only his nolledge of the world, tho in that he was
sooperior to menny a Mimber of Parlyment from the Sister Oil, but it
was his style, his grace, his orty demeaner. The Housekeeper paid him
marked attenshuns. The Ladies Maid supplyed him with Sent for his
ankerchers. The other Footmen looked up to him as their moddel, and
ewen the sollem Butler treated him with respec, and sumtimes with
sumthink else as he liked even better. The leading Gentlemen from
other Doocal establishments charfed him upon his success with the Fare,
ewen among the werry hiest of the Nobillerty, and Charles bore it all
with a good-natured larf that showed off his ivory teeth to perfecshun.
Of course it was all in fun, as they said, and probberly thort, till
on this fatal ewening, the noose spread like thunder, through the
estonished world of Fashun, that Charles had heloped with the welthy,
the middle-aged, but still bewtifool, Marchioness of St. Bendigo.

                      CHAPTER III.--_The Dewell._

The pursoot was rapid and sucksessful, and the Markissâs challenge
reyther disterbed the gilty pair at their ellegant breakfast. But
Charles was as brave as he was fare, and, having hired his fust Second
for twenty-five francs, and made a few other erangements, he met his
hantigginest on the dedly field on the follering day at the hunerthly
hour of six hay hem. Charles, with dedly haim, fired in the hair! but
the Markiss being bald, he missed him. The Markissâs haim was even more
dedly, for he, aperiently, shot his rival in his hart, for he fell
down quite flat on the new-mown hay, and dishcullered it with his blud!

The Markiss rushed up, and gave him one look of orror, and, throwing
down a Â£1,000 pound note, sed, âthat for any one who brings him two,â
and, hurrying away to his Carridge, took the next train for Lundon.
Charles recovered hisself emediately, and, pocketing the note, winked
his eye at the second second, and, giving him a hundred-franc note for
hisself, wiped away the stains of the rouge and water, and returned to
breakfast with his gilty parrer-mour.

                        CHAPTER IV.--_The End._

The poor Markiss was so horryfied at his brillyant sucksess, that
Charlesâs sanguinery corpse aunted his bed-side, and he died within
a month, a leetle munth, as _Amlet_ says, of the dredful ewent, and
Charles married his Widder. But, orful to relate, within a werry short
time Charles was a sorrowinâ Widderer, with a nincum of sum Â£10,000 a
year; and having purchased a Itallien titel for a hundred and fifty
pound, it is said as he intends shortly to return to hold Hingland;
and as the lovely Countess of Belgravier is fortnetly becum a Widder,
and a yung one, it is thought quite posserbel, by them as is behind the
seens, like myself, for instance, that before many more munce is past
and gone, there will be one lovely Widder and one andsum Widderer less
than there is now; and we is all on us ankshushly looking forred to the
day wen the gallant Count der Wennis shall lead his lovely Bride to the
halter of St. Georgeâs, Hannower Squeer, thus proving the truth of the
Poetâs fabel,--

SOME EMOTIONS BUT NO MORAL

_Lady Angleby_ (_mother of pretty dÃ©butante_). Really! Itâs positively
painful. It ought to be stopped.

_Elderly Countess_ (_with no daughters_). Eh, what? Tooth hurtinâ? Have
it out, my dear. Or try mind healinâ. Itâs very expensive, but Susan
Southwater tells me----

_Lady A._ Oh, Susan! Sheâs always got some bee in her bonnet. Though
how any self-respecting bee _could_! But I wasnât talking about teeth.
Itâs this wretched paper. Listen to this. âOne of the prettiest
_dÃ©butantes_ I saw was Miss Nora Angleby, whose mother, Lady Angleby,
was wearing nothing but a string of pearls----â

_E. C._ Have âem up for libel, my dear. I wouldnât stand it.

_Lady A._ â--nothing but a string of pearls with her white frock, and
looking so delightfully young. Everyone was saying that they might be
sisters.â Isnât it too silly?

_E. C._ Hâm! I dunno. You do look youngish sometimes. As for the
frock--donât you think it was a _leetle_ too--for the part, you know?

_Lady A._ Oh, did you think so? Itâs the way they are cutting them this
year for girls. But donât you think they ought to be pulled up?

_E. C._ The frocks, my dear, or the dressmakers, or the girls?

_Lady A._ No, no, the editors. Iâm in this wretched rag week after week.

_Mrs. Thrope (also mother of pretty dÃ©butante)._ So am I. Itâs a
perfect scandal.

_Lady A._ Are you? I donât _see_ your name anywhere.

_Mrs. T._ If you look--isnât there an account of the Hersham House Ball?

_Lady A._ Oh, yes, here you are. âMrs. Thrope, who goes everywhere, was
in great good looks and her well-known magenta frock.â Youâll have to
get a new one, darling, after that. âShe was chaperoning her daughter,
Miss Anne Thrope, another _dÃ©butante_, who was quite the beauty of
the----â Well, really! What can it matter to anyone whether Anneâs a
beauty or not, poor darling!

_Mrs. T._ She did look rather sweet, didnât she?

_Lady A._ What? Oh, ah, yes. Quite pretty, I thought. But to have it
put in print like that for any Dick, Tom, or Harry to read! It does
away with all the privacy of life.

_E. C._ Who _does_ read it--besides you two?

_Mrs. T._ Who? The suburbs, of course. Susan tells me the circulation
in Bayswater is perfectly enormous. Of course _I_ only get it to read
_her_ things.

_Lady A._ So do I. Not that they are worth reading. They always seem to
me to be so _banale_.

_Mrs. T._ Yes, arenât they? And so absolutely without point.

_E. C._ What makes âem print âem, then?

_Lady A._ Oh, money, of course. Her money. Itâs the root of all her
idylls. Sheâd pay anything they asked to get them published.

_E. C._ Hâm! Did she tell you so?

_Lady A._ My dear, of course not. But I happen to--oh, do listen to
this. I do think they might draw the line somewhere. It wouldnât be
so bad if they would keep it select. But really! _That_ woman!

_E. C._ Well, who is it?

_Lady A._ Mrs. Judesheim! A whole paragraph about her and her diamonds.
_Her_ diamonds!

_Mrs. T._ Not the Bridge woman?

_Lady A._ Positively, my dear, though one would have thought after that
last little _exposÃ©_----

_Mrs. T._ Well, really! I wonder who theyâll put in next!

_E. C._ Anyone, my dear Edith--anyone whoâll pay. Thatâs the way itâs
done. Susan wants to dispose of her articles, and, accordinâ to you,
she pays, and in they go. Mrs. Whatshername has got daughters and she
wants to dispose of _them_. So, she pays, and in _they_ go. Quite
simple, ainât it?

_Lady A._ Oh, but Iâm _sure_ you are wrong.

_Mrs. T._ I donât think you _can_ be right. We havenât come to _that_
yet.

_E. C._ _You_ havenât, my dear, of course. You buy the paper because
you--have to read Susanâs articles. Never do myself. Hate readinâ
articles, specially by people I know. But thatâs just the difference
between you two and this Judesheim woman. She _likes_ to see her name
in print. And then, her husbandâs a business man, and she knows the
value of a good advertisement.

_Lady A._ I _canât_ believe it.

_E. C._ Well, weâll ask Susan when she comes. She knows all about it.
She ought to be--ah, here she is. How do, my dear?

_Lady Susan Southwater_ (_enters hurriedly_). You dear people. I _am_
so ashamed. I simply _had_ to finish my article for next week, and it
wouldnât come.

_Lady A._ We were just talking about your articles. I particularly
liked that last one in to-dayâs paper.

_Mrs. T._ So did I. But I think--no, I donât like it quite as well as
the one _last_ week. That was too delightful. So witty.

_Lady S._ Glad you liked it. Well, are we going to cut for partners?

_E. C._ In a minute. But we want to ask you about this old rag of
yours. Do people pay to have their names in it?

_Lady S._ Tradespeople? _They_ do, of course.

_E. C._ No, no. Ordinary people like us.

_Lady S._ Oh, well--but what makes you ask?

_Lady A._ Well, the fact is, Edith and I donât like the way they _will_
put our names in, and we were just saying that; and then to read a
paragraph about that Mrs. Judesheim actually, and the whole thing
seemed so vulgar, and we were wondering whether anyone really did pay.

_Lady S._ Oh, but my dear, of course they do, though only the Editor
knows who. But if you like Iâll talk to him about you two, and say that
you would prefer not to have your names----

_Lady A._ Oh, please no, it _really_ isnât worth it. No, as far as I am
concerned personally----

_Mrs. T._ It seems to me it would be a pity to make a fuss about it.
After all, it doesnât do one any harm. So please donât trouble, darling.

_Lady S._ My dear, itâs no trouble. I shall be seeing him this evening,
anyhow. So Iâll just tell him----

_Lady A._ I beg that you will do nothing of the kind. I particularly
dislike asking favours from people of that class. Donât you think we
might begin our rubber?

_Lady S._ Perhaps that _would_ be the best solution. Unless you like to
pay him _not_ to put your names in. You might do that, you know--for a
change.

_Lady A._ You donât mean to imply----

_Lady S._ My dear, not for worlds! Some do, and some donât. But of
_course_ you and Edith----

_E. C._ Donât! Letâs cut.

THE GREAT KNEE-BREECHES QUESTION

(_A Young Blood, in trouble about his legs, soliloquises before his

Well now, this _is_ a doosid nuisance, what?â¦ Sâpose Iâve got to
face the question, now that all the rest of our set have made up
their minds.â¦ _Hate_ havinâ to make up my mind! Itâs rotten, simply
_rotten_--I donât mean my mind, but havinâ to worry over things like
this--I never was so dreadfully worried, except perhaps over the shape
of that tie last season, what?â¦ Why canât they put it off a little
while longer? But no, theyâre all goinâ to wear them next Friday at
that supper at the Carlton, and Stella Pardedewâs cominâ too--wish
I hadnât asked her, she _can_ be so cuttinâ, when she likes â¦
Iâm sure, if Iâve measured myself once, Iâve measured myself fifty
times, and I canât make âem more than ten and three-eighths round
the calf.â¦ I know sheâll ask whether itâs three calves or one,
when she sees me cominâ along â¦ rotten joke, too!â¦ Here, let me
try once more--whereâs that tape?â¦ No, I donât seem to spring to
ten and a-half inches, anyhow, and I walked the whole length of Bond
Street this afternoon, what?â¦ They donât look so bad in gaiters and
ridinâ-breeches, or under a motor-coat, and when Iâm golfinâ, too,
I can double the thick top ends of my stockinâs down and make quite
a decent show, but these silk things, what!â¦ Theyâll be sayinâ
somethinâ about advertisements for Anti-fat--that rotter Bertie will,
_I_ know, just because his are fifteen inches round.â¦

THE LATEST CRAZE

_Hostess._ Yes, I think this is so much more amusing than âBooks,â

calling herself âUnder Two Flags,â and a man insisting that he is
perfectly made up for âThe Absent-Minded Beggarâ when he wears a label
of--âQuite blind. Give me a penny,â and keeps his eyes open.

_First Lady Friend._ Certainly. Well, do you think my âCuriosityâ was
good? An old boot belonging to my great grandfather.

_Hostess._ Perfectly delightful. So nice to have a great grandfather,
and one who wore boots.

_Second Lady Friend._ Well, my âCuriosityâ is not quite so personal.
This is an old work-box that has been in our family for the last
hundred years.

_Chorus._ How interesting!

_Second Lady Friend._ And it was bought, so I have been told, at the
Exhibition of 1851.

_Professor Grumbles_ (_interposing_). Dear lady, I fancy you have made
a mistake in your dates. Now, if the box was in your family a century,
and it came from the Exhibition of 1851, it must----

_Hostess_ (_interposing_). Oh, my dear Professor, pray donât worry us
with statistics. Now, what have _you_ got?

_Professor Grumbles_ (_producing a bag_). Well dear lady, my little
contribution to the general hilarity of the occasion will be caused by
my friend in the bag. It is a specimen--a very rare specimen--of the
South African puff-adder. Most doctors will tell you that the sting
of this reptile is dangerous. (_He produces from the bag a black,
vicious-looking snake._) In fact, most people will say that the sting,
or rather a bite, is certain death. But be reassured, my good friends.
In spite of this universal belief, I may say that, without expressing
an absolutely definite opinion, _I donât think so_!

THE LADIESâ COLUMN

ABOUT TOWN.

Several ladies have chosen this week for taking walks. As I was popping
down Bond Street a few days ago I nearly ran into sweet Lady B., who
was dressed in the softest brown, with a dear little robin redbreast
perched lovingly in her _toque_, which was a veritable _dernier cri_.
There is a beautiful story in connection with the little dickey, as
Lady B. believes that it is the same little feathered darling she used
to feed with crumbs on her window-sill last winter! It is such a joy to
her tender heart to feel that her little pensioner will now never be
parted from his benefactress--while the _toque_ lasts.

A few minutes later, while I was returning the Countess of A.âs bow,
I caught my foot in the _marabout_ of one of our most unconventional
and witty American visitors, who is, by the way, the heroine of the
following delightful little story. While staying at a country house,
not a hundred miles from a certain little white village with red
roofs, the house party was taken to a local flower show. At dinner that
evening, charming Miss X., who was a member of the party, was asked by
her partner if she took an interest in gardening. âI guess Iâm only
interested in strawberry leaves!â was the witty answer.

BOOKS TO MATCH ALL DRESSES.

All lovers of literature will be delighted to hear that Miss Cumberland
Smithâs latest work, âChained by Circumstance,â is to be issued in
tooled green leather to match the dainty little belts which are being
shown this week by Mr. Peter Jay. This book would look particularly
well with a white satin Liberty _robe_, a stole of Indian work, and the
hair _coiffured_ in the _mode retroussÃ©_, which is now, we are glad to
see, once more with us.

Another little gem for book lovers is certainly Lady M.âs wonderfully
realistic âRevelations of Revolt,â bound in crimson and black. No
brunette should be without it. To go with this beautiful volume we
should strongly recommend a simple Empire costume of crimson _panne_,
with deep frills of accordion-pleated white chiffon, edged with black
_ruching_, with sprays of crimson chrysanthemums falling to the feet.

tea patronised by country cousins after a hard dayâs work shopping or

There is the institution known as a âhigh teaâ (why _high_?) for those
whose indigestion is robust enough to negotiate six oâclock beef and
tannin from the pot.

A year or two ago we were deluged with âbook teasâ and âplay teas,â or
âsong teas,â and other nursery devices for educating the middle-aged
and teaching the old idea how to make wild shots at far-fetched rebuses.

For dipsomaniacs there is, we regret to say, the D. T.; and the strict
Q. T. for persons of a secretive turn of mind.

And now a lady of high social position is in the market with bi-weekly
âConversational Teas.â Is the accent on the conversation or the tea, we
would ask? Are there any gratuities expected? Is anything given away
with a pot of tea? Do you bring your own mug? Does the lady-autocrat
at the tea-table give marks for good behaviour? Does she âturnâ you
if you have failed to learn your small-talk correctly? Do you get a
diploma (or a degree) at the end of the course if you pass the cake
with honours? And is the âcolonialâ who comes out at the bottom of
the tea-class rewarded with a wooden spoon? All these, and many other
questions, present themselves to would-be students of âhigh English
etiquette.â

GUESSES AT TRUTH.--_Mr. Laidislaw._ âHandsome woman our hostess--donât
you think? By the bye, what do you suppose her age is?â

_Miss St. Cyr._ âWell, I should fancy, what the illustrated
biographies call âPresent Day!ââ

_Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns at Home--Small and Early._

_Brown_ (_who is fighting his way in--to Friendly Party, who holds out
his hand_). âAh, how dâyâdo, Mr.--er--I seem to know your _face_. Often
met you here before, I fancy, havânât I?â

_Friendly Party._ âVery likely. My nameâs Ponsonby de Tomkyns!â]

THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH.--_Todeson_ (_who has grown his moustache,

pleasant eveninâ, to find youâve been hobnobbinâ with a shopkeeper, or
sittinâ next his wife at dinner, you know!â

_Her Grace._ âOh, dear me! Why, my _husbandâs_ a shopkeeper, Mr.
Todeson. He keeps that great bric-Ã -brac warehouse in Conduit
Street!--and the toy-shop at the corner, thatâs mine!--and the
confectioner over the way, thatâs my mother, the Duchess of Hautcastel!â

âCertainly not, dear. If theyâre dying to know us, theyâre not worth

me youâre very clever!â

_She_ (_highly amused_). âHow absurd! Iâm not a _bit_ clever!â

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
