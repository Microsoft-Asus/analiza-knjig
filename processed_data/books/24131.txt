I

Mrs. Ballinger is one of the ladies who pursue Culture in bands, as
though it were dangerous to meet alone. To this end she had founded
the Lunch Club, an association composed of herself and several other
indomitable huntresses of erudition. The Lunch Club, after three or four
winters of lunching and debate, had acquired such local distinction that
the entertainment of distinguished strangers became one of its accepted
functions; in recognition of which it duly extended to the celebrated
âOsric Dane,â on the day of her arrival in Hillbridge, an invitation to
be present at the next meeting.

The club was to meet at Mrs. Bellingerâs. The other members, behind
her back, were of one voice in deploring her unwillingness to cede
her rights in favor of Mrs. Plinth, whose house made a more impressive
setting for the entertainment of celebrities; while, as Mrs. Leveret
observed, there was always the picture-gallery to fall back on.

Mrs. Plinth made no secret of sharing this view. She had always regarded
it as one of her obligations to entertain the Lunch Clubâs distinguished
guests. Mrs. Plinth was almost as proud of her obligations as she was
of her picture-gallery; she was in fact fond of implying that the one
possession implied the other, and that only a woman of her wealth
could afford to live up to a standard as high as that which she had set
herself. An all-round sense of duty, roughly adaptable to various ends,
was, in her opinion, all that Providence exacted of the more humbly
stationed; but the power which had predestined Mrs. Plinth to keep a
footman clearly intended her to maintain an equally specialized staff of
responsibilities. It was the more to be regretted that Mrs. Ballinger,
whose obligations to society were bounded by the narrow scope of two
parlour-maids, should have been so tenacious of the right to entertain
Osric Dane.

The question of that ladyâs reception had for a month past profoundly
moved the members of the Lunch Club. It was not that they felt
themselves unequal to the task, but that their sense of the opportunity
plunged them into the agreeable uncertainty of the lady who weighs the
alternatives of a well-stocked wardrobe. If such subsidiary members as
Mrs. Leveret were fluttered by the thought of exchanging ideas with the
author of âThe Wings of Death,â no forebodings disturbed the conscious
adequacy of Mrs. Plinth, Mrs. Ballinger and Miss Van Vluyck. âThe Wings
of Deathâ had, in fact, at Miss Van Vluyckâs suggestion, been chosen as
the subject of discussion at the last club meeting, and each member had
thus been enabled to express her own opinion or to appropriate whatever
sounded well in the comments of the others.

Mrs. Roby alone had abstained from profiting by the opportunity; but it
was now openly recognised that, as a member of the Lunch Club, Mrs. Roby
was a failure. âIt all comes,â as Miss Van Vluyck put it, âof accepting
a woman on a manâs estimation.â Mrs. Roby, returning to Hillbridge from
a prolonged sojourn in exotic lands--the other ladies no longer took
the trouble to remember where--had been heralded by the distinguished
biologist, Professor Foreland, as the most agreeable woman he had ever
met; and the members of the Lunch Club, impressed by an encomium
that carried the weight of a diploma, and rashly assuming that the
Professorâs social sympathies would follow the line of his professional
bent, had seized the chance of annexing a biological member. Their
disillusionment was complete. At Miss Van Vluyckâs first off-hand
mention of the pterodactyl Mrs. Roby had confusedly murmured: âI know so
little about metres--â and after that painful betrayal of incompetence
she had prudently withdrawn from farther participation in the mental
gymnastics of the club.

âI suppose she flattered him,â Miss Van Vluyck summed up--âor else itâs
the way she does her hair.â

The dimensions of Miss Van Vluyckâs dining-room having restricted the
membership of the club to six, the nonconductiveness of one member was
a serious obstacle to the exchange of ideas, and some wonder had already
been expressed that Mrs. Roby should care to live, as it were, on the
intellectual bounty of the others. This feeling was increased by the
discovery that she had not yet read âThe Wings of Death.â She owned
to having heard the name of Osric Dane; but that--incredible as it
appeared--was the extent of her acquaintance with the celebrated
novelist. The ladies could not conceal their surprise; but Mrs.
Ballinger, whose pride in the club made her wish to put even Mrs. Roby
in the best possible light, gently insinuated that, though she had not
had time to acquaint herself with âThe Wings of Death,â she must at
least be familiar with its equally remarkable predecessor, âThe Supreme
Instant.â

Mrs. Roby wrinkled her sunny brows in a conscientious effort of memory,
as a result of which she recalled that, oh, yes, she _had_ seen the book
at her brotherâs, when she was staying with him in Brazil, and had even
carried it off to read one day on a boating party; but they had all
got to shying things at each other in the boat, and the book had gone
overboard, so she had never had the chance--

The picture evoked by this anecdote did not increase Mrs. Robyâs credit
with the club, and there was a painful pause, which was broken by Mrs.
Plinthâs remarking:

âI can understand that, with all your other pursuits, you should not
find much time for reading; but I should have thought you might at least
have _got up_ âThe Wings of Deathâ before Osric Daneâs arrival.â

Mrs. Roby took this rebuke good-humouredly. She had meant, she owned,
to glance through the book; but she had been so absorbed in a novel of
Trollopeâs that--

âNo one reads Trollope now,â Mrs. Ballinger interrupted.

Mrs. Roby looked pained. âIâm only just beginning,â she confessed.

âAnd does he interest you?â Mrs. Plinth enquired.

âHe amuses me.â

âAmusement,â said Mrs. Plinth, âis hardly what I look for in my choice
of books.â

âOh, certainly, âThe Wings of Deathâ is not amusing,â ventured Mrs.
Leveret, whose manner of putting forth an opinion was like that of an
obliging salesman with a variety of other styles to submit if his first
selection does not suit.

âWas it _meant_ to be?â enquired Mrs. Plinth, who was fond of asking
questions that she permitted no one but herself to answer. âAssuredly
not.â

âAssuredly not--that is what I was going to say,â assented Mrs. Leveret,
hastily rolling up her opinion and reaching for another. âIt was meant
to--to elevate.â

Miss Van Vluyck adjusted her spectacles as though they were the black
cap of condemnation. âI hardly see,â she interposed, âhow a book steeped
in the bitterest pessimism can be said to elevate however much it may
instruct.â

âI meant, of course, to instruct,â said Mrs. Leveret, flurried by the
unexpected distinction between two terms which she had supposed to be
synonymous. Mrs. Leveretâs enjoyment of the Lunch Club was frequently
marred by such surprises; and not knowing her own value to the other
ladies as a mirror for their mental complacency she was sometimes
troubled by a doubt of her worthiness to join in their debates. It was
only the fact of having a dull sister who thought her clever that saved
her, from a sense of hopeless inferiority.

âDo they get married in the end?â Mrs. Roby interposed.

âThey--who?â the Lunch Club collectively exclaimed.

âWhy, the girl and man. Itâs a novel, isnât it? I always think thatâs
the one thing that matters. If theyâre parted it spoils my dinner.â

Mrs. Plinth and Mrs. Ballinger exchanged scandalised glances, and the
latter said: âI should hardly advise you to read âThe Wings of Deathâ
in that spirit. For my part, when there are so many books one _has_
to read; I wonder how any one can find time for those that are merely
amusing.â

âThe beautiful part of it,â Laura Glyde murmured, âis surely just
this--that no one can tell how âThe Wings of Deathâ ends. Osric Dane,
overcome by the awful significance of her own meaning, has mercifully
veiled it--perhaps even from herself--as Apelles, in representing the
sacrifice of Iphigenia, veiled the face of Agamemnon.â

âWhatâs that? Is it poetry?â whispered Mrs. Leveret to Mrs. Plinth,
who, disdaining a definite reply, said coldly: âYou should look it up.
I always make it a point to look things up.â Her tone added--âthough I
might easily have it done for me by the footman.â

âI was about to say,â Miss Van Vluyck resumed, âthat it must always be a
question whether a book _can_ instruct unless it elevates.â

âOh--â murmured Mrs. Leveret, now feeling herself hopelessly astray.

âI donât know,â said Mrs. Ballinger, scenting in Miss Van Vluyckâs tone
a tendency to depreciate the coveted distinction of entertaining Osric
Dane; âI donât know that such a question can seriously be raised as to a
book which has attracted more attention among thoughtful people than any
novel since âRobert Elsmere.ââ

âOh, but donât you see,â exclaimed Laura Glyde, âthat itâs just the
dark hopelessness of it all--the wonderful tone-scheme of black on
black--that makes it such an artistic achievement? It reminded me when
I read it of Prince Rupertâs _maniÃ¨re noire_...the book is etched, not
painted, yet one feels the colour-values so intensely....â

âWho is he?â Mrs. Leveret whispered to her neighbour. âSome one sheâs
met abroad?â

âThe wonderful part of the book,â Mrs. Bellinger conceded, âis that it
may be looked at from so many points of view. I hear that as a study of
determinism Professor Lupton ranks it with âThe Data of Ethics.ââ

âIâm told that Osric Dane spent ten years in preparatory studies
before beginning to write it,â said Mrs. Plinth. âShe looks up
everything--verifies everything. It has always been my principle, as
you know. Nothing would induce me, now, to put aside a book before Iâd
finished it, just because I can buy as many more as I want.â

âAnd what do _you_ think of âThe Wings of Deathâ?â Mrs. Roby abruptly
asked her.

It was the kind of question that might be termed out of order, and the
ladies glanced at each other as though disclaiming any share in such
a breach of discipline. They all knew there was nothing Mrs. Plinth so
much disliked as being asked her opinion of a book. Books were written
to read; if one read them what more could be expected? To be questioned
in detail regarding the contents of a volume seemed to her as great an
outrage as being searched for smuggled laces at the Custom House. The
club had always respected this idiosyncrasy of Mrs. Plinthâs. Such
opinions as she had were imposing and substantial: her mind, like her
house, was furnished with monumental âpiecesâ that were not meant to
be disarranged; and it was one of the unwritten rules of the Lunch Club
that, within her own province, each memberâs habits of thought should be
respected. The meeting therefore closed with an increased sense, on the
part of the other ladies, of Mrs. Robyâs hopeless unfitness to be one of
them.




II

Mrs. Leveret, on the eventful day, arrived early at Mrs. Ballingerâs,
her volume of Appropriate Allusions in her pocket.

It always flustered Mrs. Leveret to be late at the Lunch Club: she liked
to collect her thoughts and gather a hint, as the others assembled, of
the turn the conversation was likely to take. To-day, however, she
felt herself completely at a loss; and even the familiar contact of
Appropriate Allusions, which stuck into her as she sat down, failed to
give her any reassurance. It was an admirable little volume, compiled
to meet all the social emergencies; so that, whether on the occasion
of Anniversaries, joyful or melancholy (as the classification ran),
of Banquets, social or municipal, or of Baptisms, Church of England
or sectarian, its student need never be at a loss for a pertinent
reference. Mrs. Leveret, though she had for years devoutly conned its
pages, valued it, however, rather for its moral support than for its
practical services; for though in the privacy of her own room she
commanded an army of quotations, these invariably deserted her at the
critical moment, and the only phrase she retained--_Canst thou draw out
leviathan with a hook_?--was one she had never yet found occasion to
apply.

To-day she felt that even the complete mastery of the volume would
hardly have insured her self-possession; for she thought it probable
that, even if she _did_, in some miraculous way, remember an Allusion,
it would be only to find that Osric Dane used a different volume (Mrs.
Leveret was convinced that literary people always carried them), and
would consequently not recognise her quotations.

Mrs. Leveretâs sense of being adrift was intensified by the appearance
of Mrs. Ballingerâs drawing-room. To a careless eye its aspect was
unchanged; but those acquainted with Mrs. Ballingerâs way of
arranging her books would instantly have detected the marks of recent
perturbation. Mrs. Ballingerâs province, as a member of the Lunch Club,
was the Book of the Day. On that, whatever it was, from a novel to
a treatise on experimental psychology, she was confidently,
authoritatively âup.â What became of last yearâs books, or last weekâs
even; what she did with the âsubjectsâ she had previously professed with
equal authority; no one had ever yet discovered. âHer mind was an hotel
where facts came and went like transient lodgers, without leaving their
address behind, and frequently without paying for their board. It was
Mrs. Ballingerâs boast that she was âabreast with the Thought of the
Day,â and her pride that this advanced position should be expressed by
the books on her table. These volumes, frequently renewed, and almost
always damp from the press, bore names generally unfamiliar to Mrs.
Leveret, and giving her, as she furtively scanned them, a disheartening
glimpse of new fields of knowledge to be breathlessly traversed in Mrs.
Ballingerâs wake. But to-day a number of maturer-looking volumes were
adroitly mingled with the _primeurs_ of the press--Karl Marx jostled
Professor Bergson, and the âConfessions of St. Augustineâ lay beside
the last work on âMendelismâ; so that even to Mrs. Leveretâs fluttered
perceptions it was clear that Mrs. Ballinger didnât in the least know
what Osric Dane was likely to talk about, and had taken measures to be
prepared for anything. Mrs. Leveret felt like a passenger on an ocean
steamer who is told that there is no immediate danger, but that she had
better put on her life-belt.

It was a relief to be roused from these forebodings by Miss Van Vluyckâs
arrival.

âWell, my dear,â the new-comer briskly asked her hostess, âwhat subjects
are we to discuss to-day?â

Mrs. Ballinger was furtively replacing a volume of Wordsworth by a copy
of Verlaine. âI hardly know,â she said, somewhat nervously. âPerhaps we
had better leave that to circumstances.â

âCircumstances?â said Miss Van Vluyck drily. âThat means, I suppose,
that Laura Glyde will take the floor as usual, and we shall be deluged
with literature.â

Philanthropy and statistics were Miss Van Vluyckâs province, and she
resented any tendency to divert their guestâs attention from these
topics.

Mrs. Plinth at this moment appeared.

âLiterature?â she protested in a tone of remonstrance. âBut this is
perfectly unexpected. I understood we were to talk of Osric Daneâs
novel.â

Mrs. Ballinger winced at the discrimination, but let it pass. âWe can
hardly make that our chief subject--at least not _too_ intentionally,â
 she suggested. âOf course we can let our talk _drift_ in that direction;
but we ought to have some other topic as an introduction, and that is
what I wanted to consult you about. The fact is, we know so little
of Osric Daneâs tastes and interests that it is difficult to make any
special preparation.â

âIt may be difficult,â said Mrs. Plinth with decision, âbut it is
necessary. I know what that happy-go-lucky principle leads to. As I told
one of my nieces the other day, there are certain emergencies for which
a lady should always be prepared. Itâs in shocking taste to wear colours
when one pays a visit of condolence, or a last yearâs dress when there
are reports that oneâs husband is on the wrong side of the market; and
so it is with conversation. All I ask is that I should know beforehand
what is to be talked about; then I feel sure of being able to say the
proper thing.â

âI quite agree with you,â Mrs. Ballinger assented; âbut--â

And at that instant, heralded by the fluttered parlourmaid, Osric Dane
appeared upon the threshold.

Mrs. Leveret told her sister afterward that she had known at a glance
what was coming. She saw that Osric Dane was not going to meet them
half way. That distinguished personage had indeed entered with an air of
compulsion not calculated to promote the easy exercise of hospitality.
She looked as though she were about to be photographed for a new edition
of her books.

The desire to propitiate a divinity is generally in inverse ratio to its
responsiveness, and the sense of discouragement produced by Osric Daneâs
entrance visibly increased the Lunch Clubâs eagerness to please her. Any
lingering idea that she might consider herself under an obligation to
her entertainers was at once dispelled by her manner: as Mrs. Leveret
said afterward to her sister, she had a way of looking at you that made
you feel as if there was something wrong with your hat. This evidence
of greatness produced such an immediate impression on the ladies that a
shudder of awe ran through them when Mrs. Roby, as their hostess led
the great personage into the dining-room, turned back to whisper to the
others: âWhat a brute she is!â

The hour about the table did not tend to revise this verdict. It was
passed by Osric Dane in the silent deglutition of Mrs. Bollingerâs menu,
and by the members of the club in the emission of tentative platitudes
which their guest seemed to swallow as perfunctorily as the successive
courses of the luncheon.

Mrs. Ballingerâs reluctance to fix a topic had thrown the club into a
mental disarray which increased with the return to the drawing-room,
where the actual business of discussion was to open. Each lady waited
for the other to speak; and there was a general shock of disappointment
when their hostess opened the conversation by the painfully commonplace
enquiry. âIs this your first visit to Hillbridge?â

Even Mrs. Leveret was conscious that this was a bad beginning; and a
vague impulse of deprecation made Miss Glyde interject: âIt is a very
small place indeed.â

Mrs. Plinth bristled. âWe have a great many representative people,â she
said, in the tone of one who speaks for her order.

Osric Dane turned to her. âWhat do they represent?â she asked.

Mrs. Plinthâs constitutional dislike to being questioned was intensified
by her sense of unpreparedness; and her reproachful glance passed the
question on to Mrs. Ballinger.

âWhy,â said that lady, glancing in turn at the other members, âas a
community I hope it is not too much to say that we stand for culture.â

âFor art--â Miss Glyde interjected.

âFor art and literature,â Mrs. Ballinger emended.

âAnd for sociology, I trust,â snapped Miss Van Vluyck.

âWe have a standard,â said Mrs. Plinth, feeling herself suddenly secure
on the vast expanse of a generalisation; and Mrs. Leveret, thinking
there must be room for more than one on so broad a statement, took
courage to murmur: âOh, certainly; we have a standard.â

âThe object of our little club,â Mrs. Ballinger continued, âis to
concentrate the highest tendencies of Hillbridge--to centralise and
focus its intellectual effort.â

This was felt to be so happy that the ladies drew an almost audible
breath of relief.

âWe aspire,â the President went on, âto be in touch with whatever is
highest in art, literature and ethics.â

Osric Dane again turned to her. âWhat ethics?â she asked.

A tremor of apprehension encircled the room. None of the ladies required
any preparation to pronounce on a question of morals; but when they
were called ethics it was different. The club, when fresh from
the âEncyclopaedia Britannica,â the âReaderâs Handbookâ or Smithâs
âClassical Dictionary,â could deal confidently with any subject; but
when taken unawares it had been known to define agnosticism as a heresy
of the Early Church and Professor Froude as a distinguished histologist;
and such minor members as Mrs. Leveret still secretly regarded ethics as
something vaguely pagan.

Even to Mrs. Ballinger, Osric Daneâs question was unsettling, and there
was a general sense of gratitude when Laura Glyde leaned forward to say,
with her most sympathetic accent: âYou must excuse us, Mrs. Dane, for
not being able, just at present, to talk of anything but âThe Wings of
Death.ââ

âYes,â said Miss Van Vluyck, with a sudden resolve to carry the war into
the enemyâs camp. âWe are so anxious to know the exact purpose you had
in mind in writing your wonderful book.â

âYou will find,â Mrs. Plinth interposed, âthat we are not superficial
readers.â

âWe are eager to hear from you,â Miss Van Vluyck continued, âif
the pessimistic tendency of the book is an expression of your own
convictions or--â

âOr merely,â Miss Glyde thrust in, âa sombre background brushed in
to throw your figures into more vivid relief. _Are_ you not primarily
plastic?â

âI have always maintained,â Mrs. Ballinger interposed, âthat you
represent the purely objective method--â

Osric Dane helped herself critically to coffee. âHow do you define
objective?â she then enquired.

There was a flurried pause before Laura Glyde intensely murmured: âIn
reading _you_ we donât define, we feel.â

Otsric Dane smiled. âThe cerebellum,â she remarked, âis not infrequently
the seat of the literary emotions.â And she took a second lump of sugar.

The sting that this remark was vaguely felt to conceal was almost
neutralised by the satisfaction of being addressed in such technical
language.

âAh, the cerebellum,â said Miss Van Vluyck complacently. âThe club took
a course in psychology last winter.â

âWhich psychology?â asked Osric Dane.

There was an agonising pause, during which each member of the club
secretly deplored the distressing inefficiency of the others. Only Mrs.
Roby went on placidly sipping her chartreuse. At last Mrs. Ballinger
said, with an attempt at a high tone: âWell, really, you know, it was
last year that we took psychology, and this winter we have been so
absorbed in--â

She broke off, nervously trying to recall some of the clubâs
discussions; but her faculties seemed to be paralysed by the petrifying
stare of Osric Dane. What _had_ the club been absorbed in? Mrs.
Ballinger, with a vague purpose of gaining time, repeated slowly: âWeâve
been so intensely absorbed in--â

Mrs. Roby put down her liqueur glass and drew near the group with a
smile.

âIn Xingu?â she gently prompted.

A thrill ran through the other members. They exchanged confused
glances, and then, with one accord, turned a gaze of mingled relief
and interrogation on their rescuer. The expression of each denoted
a different phase of the same emotion. Mrs. Plinth was the first to
compose her features to an air of reassurance: after a momentâs hasty
adjustment her look almost implied that it was she who had given the
word to Mrs. Ballinger.

âXingu, of course!â exclaimed the latter with her accustomed promptness,
while Miss Van Vluyck and Laura Glyde seemed to be plumbing the depths
of memory, and Mrs. Leveret, feeling apprehensively for Appropriate
Allusions, was somehow reassured by the uncomfortable pressure of its
bulk against her person.

Osric Daneâs change of countenance was no less striking than that of
her entertainers. She too put down her coffee-cup, but with a look of
distinct annoyance; she too wore, for a brief moment, what Mrs. Roby
afterward described as the look of feeling for something in the back
of her head; and before she could dissemble these momentary signs of
weakness, Mrs. Roby, turning to her with a deferential smile, had said:
âAnd weâve been so hoping that to-day you would tell us just what you
think of it.â

Osric Dane received the homage of the smile as a matter of course; but
the accompanying question obviously embarrassed her, and it became clear
to her observers that she was not quick at shifting her facial scenery.
It was as though her countenance had so long been set in an expression
of unchallenged superiority that the muscles had stiffened, and refused
to obey her orders.

âXingu--â she said, as if seeking in her turn to gain time.

Mrs. Roby continued to press her. âKnowing how engrossing the subject
is, you will understand how it happens that the club has let everything
else go to the wall for the moment. Since we took up Xingu I might
almost say--were it not for your books--that nothing else seems to us
worth remembering.â

Osric Daneâs stern features were darkened rather than lit up by an
uneasy smile. âI am glad to hear that you make one exception,â she gave
out between narrowed lips.

âOh, of course,â Mrs. Roby said prettily; âbut as you have shown us
that--so very naturally!--you donât care to talk of your own things, we
really canât let you off from telling us exactly what you think about
Xingu; especially,â she added, with a still more persuasive smile, âas
some people say that one of your last books was saturated with it.â

It was an _it_, then--the assurance sped like fire through the parched
minds of the other members. In their eagerness to gain the least
little clue to Xingu they almost forgot the joy of assisting at the
discomfiture of Mrs. Dane.

The latter reddened nervously under her antagonistâs challenge. âMay I
ask,â she faltered out, âto which of my books you refer?â

Mrs. Roby did not falter. âThatâs just what I want you to tell us;
because, though I was present, I didnât actually take part.â

âPresent at what?â Mrs. Dane took her up; and for an instant the
trembling members of the Lunch Club thought that the champion Providence
had raised up for them had lost a point. But Mrs. Roby explained herself
gaily: âAt the discussion, of course. And so weâre dreadfully anxious to
know just how it was that you went into the Xingu.â

There was a portentous pause, a silence so big with incalculable dangers
that the members with one accord checked the words on their lips, like
soldiers dropping their arms to watch a single combat between their
leaders. Then Mrs. Dane gave expression to their inmost dread by saying
sharply: âAh--you say _the_ Xingu, do you?â

Mrs. Roby smiled undauntedly. âIt is a shade pedantic, isnât it?
Personally, I always drop the article; but I donât know how the other
members feel about it.â

The other members looked as though they would willingly have dispensed
with this appeal to their opinion, and Mrs. Roby, after a bright glance
about the group, went on: âThey probably think, as I do, that nothing
really matters except the thing itself--except Xingu.â

No immediate reply seemed to occur to Mrs. Dane, and Mrs. Ballinger
gathered courage to say: âSurely every one must feel that about Xingu.â

Mrs. Plinth came to her support with a heavy murmur of assent, and Laura
Glyde sighed out emotionally: âI have known cases where it has changed a
whole life.â

âIt has done me worlds of good,â Mrs. Leveret interjected, seeming to
herself to remember that she had either taken it or read it the winter
before.

âOf course,â Mrs. Roby admitted, âthe difficulty is that one must give
up so much time to it. Itâs very long.â

âI canât imagine,â said Miss Van Vluyck, âgrudging the time given to
such a subject.â

âAnd deep in places,â Mrs. Roby pursued; (so then it was a book!) âAnd
it isnât easy to skip.â

âI never skip,â said Mrs. Plinth dogmatically.

âAh, itâs dangerous to, in Xingu. Even at the start there are places
where one canât. One must just wade through.â

âI should hardly call it _wading_,â said Mrs. Ballinger sarcastically.

Mrs. Roby sent her a look of interest. âAh--you always found it went
swimmingly?â

Mrs. Ballinger hesitated. âOf course there are difficult passages,â she
conceded.

âYes; some are not at all clear--even,â Mrs. Roby added, âif one is
familiar with the original.â

âAs I suppose you are?â Osric Dane interposed, suddenly fixing her with
a look of challenge.

Mrs. Roby met it by a deprecating gesture. âOh, itâs really not
difficult up to a certain point; though some of the branches are very
little known, and itâs almost impossible to get at the source.â

âHave you ever tried?â Mrs. Plinth enquired, still distrustful of Mrs.
Robyâs thoroughness.

Mrs. Roby was silent for a moment; then she replied with lowered lids:
âNo--but a friend of mine did; a very brilliant man; and he told me it
was best for women--not to....â

A shudder ran around the room. Mrs. Leveret coughed so that the
parlour-maid, who was handing the cigarettes, should not hear; Miss Van
Vluyckâs face took on a nauseated expression, and Mrs. Plinth looked as
if she were passing some one she did not care to bow to. But the most
remarkable result of Mrs. Robyâs words was the effect they produced on
the Lunch Clubâs distinguished guest. Osric Daneâs impassive features
suddenly softened to an expression of the warmest human sympathy, and
edging her chair toward Mrs. Robyâs she asked: âDid he really? And--did
you find he was right?â

Mrs. Ballinger, in whom annoyance at Mrs. Robyâs unwonted assumption
of prominence was beginning to displace gratitude for the aid she had
rendered, could not consent to her being allowed, by such dubious means,
to monopolise the attention of their guest. If Osric Dane had not enough
self-respect to resent Mrs. Robyâs flippancy, at least the Lunch Club
would do so in the person of its President.

Mrs. Ballinger laid her hand on Mrs. Robyâs arm. âWe must not forget,â
 she said with a frigid amiability, âthat absorbing as Xingu is to _us_,
it may be less interesting to--â

âOh, no, on the contrary, I assure you,â Osric Dane intervened.

â--to others,â Mrs. Ballinger finished firmly; âand we must not allow
our little meeting to end without persuading Mrs. Dane to say a few
words to us on a subject which, to-day, is much more present in all our
thoughts. I refer, of course, to âThe Wings of Death.ââ

The other members, animated by various degrees of the same sentiment,
and encouraged by the humanised mien of their redoubtable guest,
repeated after Mrs. Ballinger: âOh, yes, you really _must_ talk to us a
little about your book.â

Osric Daneâs expression became as bored, though not as haughty, as when
her work had been previously mentioned. But before she could respond
to Mrs. Ballingerâs request, Mrs. Roby had risen from her seat, and was
pulling down her veil over her frivolous nose.

âIâm so sorry,â she said, advancing toward her hostess with outstretched
hand, âbut before Mrs. Dane begins I think Iâd better run away.
Unluckily, as you know, I havenât read her books, so I should be at a
terrible disadvantage among you all, and besides, Iâve an engagement to
play bridge.â

If Mrs. Roby had simply pleaded her ignorance of Osric Daneâs works as
a reason for withdrawing, the Lunch Club, in view of her recent prowess,
might have approved such evidence of discretion; but to couple this
excuse with the brazen announcement that she was foregoing the privilege
for the purpose of joining a bridge-party was only one more instance of
her deplorable lack of discrimination.

The ladies were disposed, however, to feel that her departure--now
that she had performed the sole service she was ever likely to render
them--would probably make for greater order and dignity in the impending
discussion, besides relieving them of the sense of self-distrust which
her presence always mysteriously produced. Mrs. Ballinger therefore
restricted herself to a formal murmur of regret, and the other members
were just grouping themselves comfortably about Osric Dane when the
latter, to their dismay, started up from the sofa on which she had been
seated.

âOh wait--do wait, and Iâll go with you!â she called out to Mrs. Roby;
and, seizing the hands of the disconcerted members, she administered
a series of farewell pressures with the mechanical haste of a
railway-conductor punching tickets.

âIâm so sorry--Iâd quite forgotten--â she flung back at them from the
threshold; and as she joined Mrs. Roby, who had turned in surprise at
her appeal, the other ladies had the mortification of hearing her say,
in a voice which she did not take the pains to lower: âIf youâll let
me walk a little way with you, I should so like to ask you a few more
questions about Xingu....â




III

The incident had been so rapid that the door closed on the departing
pair before the other members had time to understand what was
happening. Then a sense of the indignity put upon them by Osric Daneâs
unceremonious desertion began to contend with the confused feeling that
they had been cheated out of their due without exactly knowing how or
why.

There was a silence, during which Mrs. Ballinger, with a perfunctory
hand, rearranged the skilfully grouped literature at which her
distinguished guest had not so much as glanced; then Miss Van Vluyck
tartly pronounced: âWell, I canât say that I consider Osric Daneâs
departure a great loss.â

This confession crystallised the resentment of the other members, and
Mrs. Leveret exclaimed: âI do believe she came on purpose to be nasty!â

It was Mrs. Plinthâs private opinion that Osric Daneâs attitude toward
the Lunch Club might have been very different had it welcomed her in the
majestic setting of the Plinth drawing-rooms; but not liking to reflect
on the inadequacy of Mrs. Ballingerâs establishment she sought a
roundabout satisfaction in depreciating her lack of foresight.

âI said from the first that we ought to have had a subject ready. Itâs
what always happens when youâre unprepared. Now if weâd only got up
Xingu--â

The slowness of Mrs. Plinthâs mental processes was always allowed for
by the club; but this instance of it was too much for Mrs. Ballingerâs
equanimity.

âXingu!â she scoffed. âWhy, it was the fact of our knowing so much more
about it than she did--unprepared though we were--that made Osric Dane
so furious. I should have thought that was plain enough to everybody!â

This retort impressed even Mrs. Plinth, and Laura Glyde, moved by an
impulse of generosity, said: âYes, we really ought to be grateful
to Mrs. Roby for introducing the topic. It may have made Osric Dane
furious, but at least it made her civil.â

âI am glad we were able to show her,â added Miss Van Vluyck, âthat a
broad and up-to-date culture is not confined to the great intellectual
centres.â

This increased the satisfaction of the other members, and they began
to forget their wrath against Osric Dane in the pleasure of having
contributed to her discomfiture.

Miss Van Vluyck thoughtfully rubbed her spectacles. âWhat surprised me
most,â she continued, âwas that Fanny Roby should be so up on Xingu.â

This remark threw a slight chill on the company, but Mrs. Ballinger
said with an air of indulgent irony: âMrs. Roby always has the knack of
making a little go a long way; still, we certainly owe her a debt for
happening to remember that sheâd heard of Xingu.â And this was felt by
the other members to be a graceful way of cancelling once for all the
clubâs obligation to Mrs. Roby.

Even Mrs. Leveret took courage to speed a timid shaft of irony. âI fancy
Osric Dane hardly expected to take a lesson in Xingu at Hillbridge!â

Mrs. Ballinger smiled. âWhen she asked me what we represented--do you
remember?--I wish Iâd simply said we represented Xingu!â

All the ladies laughed appreciatively at this sally, except Mrs. Plinth,
who said, after a momentâs deliberation: âIâm not sure it would have
been wise to do so.â

Mrs. Ballinger, who was already beginning to feel as if she had
launched at Osric Dane the retort which had just occurred to her, turned
ironically on Mrs. Plinth. âMay I ask why?â she enquired.

Mrs. Plinth looked grave. âSurely,â she said, âI understood from Mrs.
Roby herself that the subject was one it was as well not to go into too
deeply?â

Miss Van Vluyck rejoined with precision: âI think that applied only to
an investigation of the origin of the--of the--â; and suddenly she found
that her usually accurate memory had failed her. âItâs a part of the
subject I never studied myself/,â she concluded.

âNor I,â said Mrs. Ballinger.

Laura Glyde bent toward them with widened eyes. âAnd yet it
seems--doesnât it?--the part that is fullest of an esoteric
fascination?â

âI donât know on what you base that,â said Miss Van Vluyck
argumentatively.

âWell, didnât you notice how intensely interested Osric Dane became as
soon as she heard what the brilliant foreigner--he _was_ a foreigner,
wasnât he?--had told Mrs. Roby about the origin--the origin of the
rite--or whatever you call it?â

Mrs. Plinth looked disapproving, and Mrs. Ballinger visibly wavered.
Then she said: âIt may not be desirable to touch on the--on that part
of the subject in general conversation; but, from the importance it
evidently has to a woman of Osric Daneâs distinction, I feel as if
we ought not to be afraid to discuss it among ourselves--without
gloves--though with closed doors, if necessary.â

âIâm quite of your opinion,â Miss Van Vluyck came briskly to her
support; âon condition, that is, that all grossness of language is
avoided.â

âOh, Iâm sure we shall understand without that,â Mrs. Leveret tittered;
and Laura Glyde added significantly: âI fancy we can read between the
lines,â while Mrs. Ballinger rose to assure herself that the doors
were really closed.

Mrs. Plinth had not yet given her adhesion. âI hardly see,â she
began, âwhat benefit is to be derived from investigating such peculiar
customs--â

But Mrs. Ballingerâs patience had reached the extreme limit of tension.
âThis at least,â she returned; âthat we shall not be placed again in the
humiliating position of finding ourselves less up on our own subjects
than Fanny Roby!â

Even to Mrs. Plinth this argument was conclusive. She peered furtively
about the room and lowered her commanding tones to ask: âHave you got a
copy?â

âA--a copy?â stammered Mrs. Ballinger. She was aware that the other
members were looking at her expectantly, and that this answer was
inadequate, so she supported it by asking another question. âA copy of
what?â

Her companions bent their expectant gaze on Mrs. Plinth, who, in turn,
appeared less sure of herself than usual. âWhy, of--of--the book,â she
explained.

âWhat book?â snapped Miss Van Vluyck, almost as sharply as Osric Dane.

Mrs. Ballinger looked at Laura Glyde, whose eyes were interrogatively
fixed on Mrs. Leveret. The fact of being deferred to was so new to
the latter that it filled her with an insane temerity. âWhy, Xingu, of
course!â she exclaimed.

A profound silence followed this challenge to the resources of Mrs.
Ballingerâs library, and the latter, after glancing nervously toward the
Books of the Day, returned with dignity: âItâs not a thing one cares to
leave about.â

âI should think not!â exclaimed Mrs. Plinth.

âIt _is_ a book, then?â said Miss Van Vluyck.

This again threw the company into disarray, and Mrs. Ballinger, with an
impatient sigh, rejoined: âWhy--there _is_ a book--naturally....â

âThen why did Miss Glyde call it a religion?â

Laura Glyde started up. âA religion? I never--â

âYes, you did,â Miss Van Vluyck insisted; âyou spoke of rites; and Mrs.
Plinth said it was a custom.â

Miss Glyde was evidently making a desperate effort to recall her
statement; but accuracy of detail was not her strongest point. At length
she began in a deep murmur: âSurely they used to do something of the
kind at the Eleusinian mysteries--â

âOh--â said Miss Van Vluyck, on the verge of disapproval; and Mrs.
Plinth protested: âI understood there was to be no indelicacy!â

Mrs. Ballinger could not control her irritation. âReally, it is too
bad that we should not be able to talk the matter over quietly among
ourselves. Personally, I think that if one goes into Xingu at all--â

âOh, so do I!â cried Miss Glyde.

âAnd I donât see how one can avoid doing so, if one wishes to keep up
with the Thought of the Day--â

Mrs. Leveret uttered an exclamation of relief. âThere--thatâs it!â she
interposed.

âWhatâs it?â the President took her up.

âWhy--itâs a--a Thought: I mean a philosophy.â

This seemed to bring a certain relief to Mrs. Ballinger and Laura Glyde,
but Miss Van Vluyck said: âExcuse me if I tell you that youâre all
mistaken. Xingu happens to be a language.â

âA language!â the Lunch Club cried.

âCertainly. Donât you remember Fanny Robyâs saying that there were
several branches, and that some were hard to trace? What could that
apply to but dialects?â

Mrs. Ballinger could no longer restrain a contemptuous laugh. âReally,
if the Lunch Club has reached such a pass that it has to go to Fanny
Roby for instruction on a subject like Xingu, it had almost better cease
to exist!â

âItâs really her fault for not being clearer,â Laura Glyde put in.

âOh, clearness and Fanny Roby!â Mrs. Ballinger shrugged. âI daresay we
shall find she was mistaken on almost every point.â

âWhy not look it up?â said Mrs. Plinth.

As a rule this recurrent suggestion of Mrs. Plinthâs was ignored in the
heat of discussion, and only resorted to afterward in the privacy of
each memberâs home. But on the present occasion the desire to ascribe
their own confusion of thought to the vague and contradictory nature of
Mrs. Robyâs statements caused the members of the Lunch Club to utter a
collective demand for a book of reference.

At this point the production of her treasured volume gave Mrs. Leveret,
for a moment, the unusual experience of occupying the centre front; but
she was not able to hold it long, for Appropriate Allusions contained no
mention of Xingu.

âOh, thatâs not the kind of thing we want!â exclaimed Miss Van Vluyck.
She cast a disparaging glance over Mrs. Ballingerâs assortment of
literature, and added impatiently: âHavenât you any useful books?â

âOf course I have,â replied Mrs. Ballinger indignantly; âI keep them in
my husbandâs dressing-room.â

From this region, after some difficulty and delay, the parlour-maid
produced the W-Z volume of an Encyclopaedia and, in deference to the
fact that the demand for it had come from Miss Van Vluyck, laid the
ponderous tome before her.

There was a moment of painful suspense while Miss Van Vluyck rubbed her
spectacles, adjusted them, and turned to Z; and a murmur of surprise
when she said: âIt isnât here.â

âI suppose,â said Mrs. Plinth, âitâs not fit to be put in a book of
reference.â

âOh, nonsense!â exclaimed Mrs. Ballinger. âTry X.â

Miss Van Vluyck turned back through the volume, peering short-sightedly
up and down the pages, till she came to a stop and remained motionless,
like a dog on a point.

âWell, have you found it?â Mrs. Ballinger enquired after a considerable
delay.

âYes. Iâve found it,â said Miss Van Vluyck in a queer voice.

Mrs. Plinth hastily interposed: âI beg you wonât read it aloud if
thereâs anything offensive.â

Miss Van Vluyck, without answering, continued her silent scrutiny.

âWell, what _is_ it?â exclaimed Laura Glyde excitedly.

â_Do_ tell us!â urged Mrs. Leveret, feeling that she would have
something awful to tell her sister.

Miss Van Vluyck pushed the volume aside and turned slowly toward the
expectant group.

âItâs a river.â

âA _river?_â

âYes: in Brazil. Isnât that where sheâs been living?â

âWho? Fanny Roby? Oh, but you must be mistaken. Youâve been reading the
wrong thing,â Mrs. Ballinger exclaimed, leaning over her to seize the
volume.

âItâs the only Xingu in the Encyclopaedia; and she _has_ been living in
Brazil,â Miss Van Vluyck persisted.

âYes: her brother has a consulship there,â Mrs. Leveret interposed.

âBut itâs too ridiculous! I--we--why we _all_ remember studying Xingu
last year--or the year before last,â Mrs. Ballinger stammered.

âI thought I did when _you_ said so,â Laura Glyde avowed.

âI said so?â cried Mrs. Ballinger.

âYes. You said it had crowded everything else out of your mind.â

âWell _you_ said it had changed your whole life!â

âFor that matter. Miss Van Vluyck said she had never grudged the time
sheâd given it.â

Mrs. Plinth interposed: âI made it clear that I knew nothing whatever of
the original.â

Mrs. Ballinger broke off the dispute with a groan. âOh, what does it
all matter if sheâs been making fools of us? I believe Miss Van Vluyckâs
right--she was talking of the river all the while!â

âHow could she? Itâs too preposterous,â Miss Glyde exclaimed.

âListen.â Miss Van Vluyck had repossessed herself of the Encyclopaedia,
and restored her spectacles to a nose reddened by excitement. ââThe
Xingu, one of the principal rivers of Brazil, rises on the plateau of
Mato Grosso, and flows in a northerly direction for a length of no less
than one thousand one hundred and eighteen miles, entering the Amazon
near the mouth of the latter river. The upper course of the Xingu is
auriferous and fed by numerous branches. Its source was first discovered
in 1884 by the German explorer von den Steinen, after a difficult and
dangerous expedition through a region inhabited by tribes still in the
Stone Age of culture.ââ

The ladies received this communication in a state of stupefied silence
from which Mrs. Leveret was the first to rally. âShe certainly _did_
speak of its having branches.â

The word seemed to snap the last thread of their incredulity. âAnd of
its great length,â gasped Mrs. Ballinger.

âShe said it was awfully deep, and you couldnât skip--you just had to
wade through,â Miss Glyde added.

The idea worked its way more slowly through Mrs. Plinthâs compact
resistances. âHow could there be anything improper about a river?â she
enquired.

âImproper?â

âWhy, what she said about the source--that it was corrupt?â

âNot corrupt, but hard to get at,â Laura Glyde corrected. âSome
one whoâd been there had told her so. I daresay it was the explorer
himself--doesnât it say the expedition was dangerous?â

ââDifficult and dangerous,ââ read Miss Van Vluyck.

Mrs. Ballinger pressed her hands to her throbbing temples. âThereâs
nothing she said that wouldnât apply to a river--to this river!â She
swung about excitedly to the other members. âWhy, do you remember her
telling us that she hadnât read âThe Supreme Instantâ because sheâd
taken it on a boating party while she was staying with her brother,
and some one had âshiedâ it overboard--âshiedâ of course was her own
expression.â

The ladies breathlessly signified that the expression had not escaped
them.

âWell--and then didnât she tell Osric Dane that one of her books was
simply saturated with Xingu? Of course it was, if one of Mrs. Robyâs
rowdy friends had thrown it into the river!â

This surprising reconstruction of the scene in which they had just
participated left the members of the Lunch Club inarticulate. At length,
Mrs. Plinth, after visibly labouring with the problem, said in a heavy
tone: âOsric Dane was taken in too.â

Mrs. Leveret took courage at this. âPerhaps thatâs what Mrs. Roby did
it for. She said Osric Dane was a brute, and she may have wanted to give
her a lesson.â

Miss Van Vluyck frowned. âIt was hardly worth while to do it at our
expense.â

âAt least,â said Miss Glyde with a touch of bitterness, âshe succeeded
in interesting her, which was more than we did.â

âWhat chance had we?â rejoined Mrs. Ballinger.

âMrs. Roby monopolised her from the first. And _that_, Iâve no doubt,
was her purpose--to give Osric Dane a false impression of her own
standing in the club. She would hesitate at nothing to attract
attention: we all know how she took in poor Professor Foreland.â

âShe actually makes him give bridge-teas every Thursday,â Mrs. Leveret
piped up.

Laura Glyde struck her hands together. âWhy, this is Thursday, and itâs
_there_ sheâs gone, of course; and taken Osric with her!â

âAnd theyâre shrieking over us at this moment,â said Mrs. Ballinger
between her teeth.

This possibility seemed too preposterous to be admitted. âShe would
hardly dare,â said Miss Van Vluyck, âconfess the imposture to Osric
Dane.â

âIâm not so sure: I thought I saw her make a sign as she left. If she
hadnât made a sign, why should Osric Dane have rushed out after her?â

âWell, you know, weâd all been telling her how wonderful Xingu was, and
she said she wanted to find out more about it,â Mrs. Leveret said, with
a tardy impulse of justice to the absent.

This reminder, far from mitigating the wrath of the other members, gave
it a stronger impetus.

âYes--and thatâs exactly what theyâre both laughing over now,â said
Laura Glyde ironically.

Mrs. Plinth stood up and gathered her expensive furs about her
monumental form. âI have no wish to criticise,â she said; âbut unless
the Lunch Club can protect its members against the recurrence of
such--such unbecoming scenes, I for one--â

âOh, so do I!â agreed Miss Glyde, rising also.

Miss Van Vluyck closed the Encyclopaedia and proceeded to button herself
into her jacket âMy time is really too valuable--â she began.

âI fancy we are all of one mind,â said Mrs. Ballinger, looking
searchingly at Mrs. Leveret, who looked at the others.

âI always deprecate anything like a scandal--â Mrs. Plinth continued.

âShe has been the cause of one to-day!â exclaimed Miss Glyde.

Mrs. Leveret moaned: âI donât see how she _could!_â and Miss Van Vluyck
said, picking up her note-book: âSome women stop at nothing.â

â--but if,â Mrs. Plinth took up her argument impressively, âanything
of the kind had happened in _my_ houseâ (it never would have, her tone
implied), âI should have felt that I owed it to myself either to ask for
Mrs. Robyâs resignation--or to offer mine.â

âOh, Mrs. Plinth--â gasped the Lunch Club.

âFortunately for me,â Mrs. Plinth continued with an awful magnanimity,
âthe matter was taken out of my hands by our Presidentâs decision that
the right to entertain distinguished guests was a privilege vested in
her office; and I think the other members will agree that, as she was
alone in this opinion, she ought to be alone in deciding on the best way
of effacing its--its really deplorable consequences.â

A deep silence followed this outbreak of Mrs. Plinthâs long-stored
resentment.

âI donât see why I should be expected to ask her to resign--â Mrs.
Ballinger at length began; but Laura Glyde turned back to remind her:
âYou know she made you say that youâd got on swimmingly in Xingu.â

An ill-timed giggle escaped from Mrs. Leveret, and Mrs. Ballinger
energetically continued â--but you neednât think for a moment that Iâm
afraid to!â

The door of the drawing-room closed on the retreating backs of the
Lunch Club, and the President of that distinguished association, seating
herself at her writing-table, and pushing away a copy of âThe Wings of
Deathâ to make room for her elbow, drew forth a sheet of the clubâs
note-paper, on which she began to write: âMy dear Mrs. Roby--â

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenbergâ), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  âProject Gutenbergâ is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (âthe Foundationâ
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenbergâ is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase âProject Gutenbergâ associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, âInformation about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.â

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the âRight
of Replacement or Refundâ described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you âAS-ISâ WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmâs
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
